# Grounding Our Worldview: A Metaphysical Exploration of God

# Session 2: Dispelling Myths – Modern Misconceptions of God

## **Overview:** 

In today’s skeptical climate, caricatures of God often take center stage. Popular atheist books and internet memes reduce God to an “invisible sky fairy” or a grumpy old man with a beard sitting on a cloud. Such images make for easy mockery, but they are *straw men* – misrepresentations that no serious Christian actually believes in. When critics equate God with a childish superstition or a capricious “man upstairs,” they are not engaging with what classical Christian theology really claims. In effect, many skeptics are refuting a *“patently silly straw man”* instead of the true Christian concept of God. As one commentator noted, this lets them “go easy on themselves” by defeating a trivial idea rather than wrestling with the real thing. In this session, we’ll replace ridicule with understanding – examining a few common misconceptions about God and patiently correcting them. We’ll see that modern atheism often misunderstands the *classical* concept of God, and we’ll challenge ourselves to appreciate who God truly is: not a mere bigger version of us, but *the transcendent Creator* beyond all. We’ll also reflect on our own thinking, since even devout believers can slip into too-narrow ideas of God. Scripture reminds us that God is both the Almighty King beyond space and time **and** the loving Father who knows every hair on our heads (Matthew 10:30). Keeping this balance will strengthen our faith and guard us from confusion.

## **Myth 1: “God is just an ancient superstition or a psychological crutch.”**

One common jibe is that belief in God is no more rational than belief in the Tooth Fairy or Santa Claus – just a comforting fiction for the weak or uneducated. The implication is that religion survives only as a *psychological crutch* or a leftover “ancient superstition,” bound to vanish as science advances. However, this claim ignores the **robust philosophical reasoning and lived experiences** that have led countless thinkers to affirm God’s reality. Far from being a mere “gap-filler” for ignorance, Christian belief offers a coherent explanation for *why anything exists at all*, including reason and scientific law. The very fact that the universe is intelligible points to a rational ground of being (John 1:1) rather than a chaotic accident. Philosophers from Aristotle to Aquinas to Alvin Plantinga have presented careful arguments for God – arguments from the existence of contingent beings, from the beginning of the universe, from the reality of moral and logical truths, etc. These aren’t appeals to magic but to *explanation*. For example, the cosmological argument asks **“Why is there something rather than nothing?”** and concludes that a necessary, uncaused reality (God) is the best answer. Even atheist philosophers recognize that the question of existence is a profound one. (Notably, Gottfried Leibniz argued that the sufficient reason for the world must lie in a **necessary being** that contains the reason for its own existence, rather than in an infinite series of contingent things.) Dismissing God as a superstition does not solve the riddle of existence – it only sidesteps it.

It’s also worth noting that **many brilliant, rational people believe in God**, which undermines the idea that faith is purely a crutch for the ignorant. The atheist scholar Thomas Nagel once admitted he was unsettled by the fact that “some of the most intelligent and well-informed people” he knew were theists. Their belief was not born of stupidity or wish-fulfillment, but often of careful reflection and even personal encounter. Of course, *comfort* can be one aspect of faith – God does bring comfort to the hurting – but that doesn’t mean God is *only* a human invention for comfort. (To call belief false *because* it’s comforting would be to commit the “genetic fallacy,” confusing the cause of an idea with its truth.) We should gently point out that **truth** isn’t determined by how a belief makes us feel. The reality of God stands or falls on evidence and reason, not on whether it’s comforting or old. And in fact, Christian faith has persisted not because it avoids hard questions, but because it has resources to answer them. It’s not about shutting off inquiry; it’s about making sense of all that we discover. Rather than being *anti*-reason, Christianity historically fueled the rise of science and philosophy (many early scientists were devout). In short, believers do not see God as an “opium” to numb them, but as the Logos – the mind behind reality that makes rational thought and discovery possible. Our task, then, is to invite skeptics to move beyond shallow dismissals and actually consider the case for God with the same seriousness they’d consider any other big question. As Psalm 19:1 says, *“the heavens declare the glory of God”* – there is something out there to be noticed, if we’re willing to look.

## **Myth 2: “Believers think God is a big man upstairs who intervenes occasionally (a ‘god of the gaps’).”**

Another misconception is that Christians imagine God as a **magnified human** – a “big guy in the sky” who mostly stays away, except to occasionally meddle with miracles when something needs fixing. Critics like Richard Dawkins have attacked this idea, describing God as just a super-powerful being or “a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak” in the sky. But this critique is aimed at a *false target*. **Classical Christianity does not view God as a mere being within the universe at all.** God is not an old man on a cloud, nor a semi-invisible angel, nor a “chief engineer” who pops in to plug holes in natural processes. Rather, God is understood as *the very ground of all being* – the reason anything exists or happens at every moment. Far from only “intervening” occasionally, the true God is continuously and actively sustaining the universe. As Scripture says, *“He upholds all things by the word of His power”* (Hebrews 1:3). In Him we live, move, and have our being (Acts 17:28). Every beat of our heart, every law of physics, every instant of existence is *dependant* on God’s sustaining will.

This is a key distinction: God is **the primary cause of being** itself, whereas science describes secondary causes (the mechanisms within creation). We don’t have to choose between God *or* science; God isn’t in competition with natural laws – he’s the author of nature on which those laws depend. The caricature of a “god of the gaps” – a deity only invoked to explain what science hasn’t yet explained – completely misrepresents classical theism. St. Thomas Aquinas, for example, saw God not as a placeholder for ignorance, but as the *necessary foundation* even for a fully understood natural world. If every physical process were mapped out, one could still ask “why does anything exist at all?” or “why do these laws hold?” and that points to God. As a modern philosopher quipped, God is not just an explanation for *one more thing* in the universe – God is an explanation for **why there’s a universe with things in it**.

Crucially, Christians affirm that **God is *not*** *“a man upstairs”* or an item in the universe. He is *Being itself*, eternal, immaterial, and omnipresent. The Bible stresses this transcendence: *“Heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain You”* (1 Kings 8:27). *“God is spirit”* (John 4:24), not flesh; *“God is not a man”* (Numbers 23:19). When skeptics ask, “Why can’t we see God or detect Him like we do a planet or a star?”, they are missing the category difference. God isn’t one more object within space and time – He’s the **source** of all space and time. Looking for God with a telescope or particle accelerator is as misdirected as looking for a painter *inside* his painting. The Christian view is that God’s presence underlies all of reality, and *everything* is evidence of Him (when properly understood), not just the gaps in our current knowledge.

By understanding God this way, we avoid the mistake of those who think believers regard God like Zeus or Thor – a being *within* nature throwing occasional lightning bolts. That pagan notion was rejected long ago. A helpful saying (attributed to R.C. Sproul and others) is: **“God is not just a bigger, better version of human beings. No, He is an entirely different kind of being altogether.”** God is the creator, we are creatures; the difference is qualitative, not just quantitative. He has no limits, whereas we are limited. So when someone scoffs, “You believe in a magic man in the sky,” we can clarify: *No, we believe in a transcendent Spirit who is the very reason anything exists or works.* Reducing Him to an “old man” is like reducing the Sun to a candle – an absurd diminishment. The irony is that by attacking this dumbed-down version of God, critics haven’t actually touched the God Christians believe in. They’ve only knocked down a straw effigy. We can invite them to contend with the real vision of God – one in which God is intimately involved in upholding the universe at every second, yet not limited like any creature. This vision actually makes more sense of why a orderly universe *can* exist (since it depends on an ultimate order-giver). In sum, **God is not a distant handyman who only visits occasionally; He’s the continuous source of all reality.** There are no “gaps” in which God is *not* at work – as the Book of Acts says, “he is **not far from each one of us**” (Acts 17:27).

## **Myth 3: “If God created the universe, then who created God?”**

On the surface, this question sounds clever – it’s often posed with a gotcha-tone, as if to say “Aha! You haven’t solved the problem, you’ve just moved it back a step.” In fact, Richard Dawkins in *The God Delusion* claims the idea of God only multiplies the mystery, asking who designed the Designer. But this objection actually **misunderstands what Christians mean by “God.”** By definition, God is the **Uncreated First Cause** – the ultimate reality that always was. To ask “Who created the uncreated Creator?” is a *category mistake*, akin to asking “Whom is the bachelor married to?” or “What does the color red taste like?” It’s applying the wrong category to the subject. If we truly grasp the concept of God, we know that **God is eternal and necessary** – with no beginning, no cause. All major Christian traditions teach that God exists *ase* (from Himself), whereas everything else exists *ab alio* (from another). So the question “Who made God?” is nonsensical – we don’t believe in a “made” God at all. (If something were made or caused, by definition it wouldn’t be God.)

Usually, the confusion comes from a sloppy formulation of the argument. A skeptic might say, “Well, **you** Christians say *everything* needs a creator; so God would need one too!” But that’s not what we say. The traditional argument is not “everything needs a cause,” but **“everything that *begins* to exist or is contingent needs a cause.”** God, unlike the universe, did not begin to exist and is not contingent (not a “maybe” being that could fail to exist). God is understood as the **Necessary Being** – the one whose very nature is existence itself, who cannot *not* exist. The universe, by contrast, is contingent – it didn’t have to exist, and it appears to have had a beginning (whether in the Big Bang or otherwise). Tracing back causes within the universe (even to a Big Bang) still leaves us with the question of *why* there is a universe at all, and why it has the laws it does. An infinite regress of physical causes **would not actually answer** the ultimate question – it would just push it further back. Imagine a chain hanging in midair: even if the chain were infinitely long, it still wouldn’t explain why the whole chain is hanging at all. You’d need a hook in the ceiling to hold it. Similarly, an infinite chain of contingent causes requires something outside the chain to ground it. As Aquinas argued, there must be a First Cause that is *ontologically primary* – a cause that doesn’t derive its existence from anything more fundamental. In his reasoning, *“there must exist a First Cause whose essence is not distinct from its existence”*, meaning a being that *just is* existence, rather than having existence imparted to it. Only such a being explains why there is a world of beings at all.

Philosopher Gottfried Leibniz put it this way: even if matter had existed forever, we still need to ask *“Why is there something rather than nothing?”* He concluded that the answer lies in a necessary entity that contains the reason for its own existence (sometimes called the “sufficient reason”). This aligns perfectly with the Christian concept of God. By contrast, asking “Who created God?” mistakes God for a contingent object within a larger framework. It’s like reading a mystery novel and upon finding out the final solution, demanding “Yes, but what’s the cause of *that* cause?” – at some point, an ultimate explanation is reached. **God is that ultimate explanation.** Theists are not arbitrarily exempting God from a rule; rather, God is, by definition, the sort of reality that doesn’t need an external cause (just as by definition a triangle has three sides – it’s in the very concept). If someone insists that *everything* must have a cause, including God, then logically there would be an infinite regress with no ultimate explanation – which solves nothing. Instead, classical theism holds that **something fundamental always existed**. Either matter/energy has existed eternally (which even then raises the question of why its nature is what it is), or something beyond matter has. The evidence of a beginning to the cosmos and the contingency of physical laws points many of us to conclude that an eternal Mind is the better candidate.

To put it in a simpler analogy: Suppose a skeptic says, “I refuse to accept *God* as the uncaused cause – I’ll only accept a scientific cause.” Then you ask, “What caused that scientific cause?” If they eventually say the chain of causes just exists without explanation, they’ve essentially put **impersonal nature** in the role of “uncaused cause.” But why is that more rational? If anything, an eternal Mind (ground of reason and order) seems a more fitting uncaused cause than a brute, mindless material stuff. Either way, everyone ends up positing something uncreated or self-existent. Christians just posit One that is *intelligent* and purposeful, which actually gives a reason for the order and existence we see. In summary, **“Who made God?”** is a misguided question – Christians are not inserting a temporary “Creator” who would then need another creator. We’re pointing to the **ultimate, unmade Source** of all being. As the **Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy** notes, Stephen Hawking’s famous question *“Who created God?”* is considered *“out of place”* by theists, because it misunderstands the category in question. The Bible itself assumes God’s eternal nature: *“From everlasting to everlasting, You are God”* (Psalm 90:2). Isaiah 44:6 records God saying, *“I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god.”* That is the God Christians worship – the uncreated Creator.

(For those interested, **Thomas Aquinas’s arguments** deal with this elegantly: he distinguishes between an essentially ordered series of causes (which must have a simultaneous First Cause) and an accidentally ordered series (which could, theoretically, stretch back indefinitely in time). When it comes to *existence here and now*, Aquinas showed that even now there must be a sustaining cause underlying all intermediate causes. The First Cause isn’t just the beginning of a timeline – it’s the foundation of the whole chain’s being. Thus the question of “What came before God?” is irrelevant; God isn’t another link in the temporal chain, but the eternal bedrock on which the chain hangs.)

In summary, the question “Who created God?” is based on a misunderstanding. A more productive question is, “*What kind of cause could explain the existence of the contingent universe?*” And the classical answer is: a cause that exists by its own nature (necessary), is eternal, immaterial, all-powerful (since it produces all things), and personal (to choose to create). In other words – God.

## **Myth 4: “The Bible depicts God as an angry man – believers think God has human moods and a physical body.”**

Skeptics sometimes point to Old Testament passages where God appears to have human traits – walking in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:8), displaying anger or regret, or being called a “Father” with hands and eyes. They might say, “See, your own Bible portrays God as a man-like being with emotions. Isn’t God just an anthropomorphic projection – a big guy with superpowers?” It’s true that Scripture **uses human terms** to describe God’s actions and feelings. But Christian theology has long recognized these as *figures of speech*, not literal assertions that God is physically or emotionally human. We call these expressions **anthropomorphisms** (attributing human form to God) and **anthropopathisms** (attributing human emotions to God). They are analogies – ways of speaking that *point toward truths about God* in terms we can grasp, without claiming that God is exactly like us.

For instance, when the Bible says, *“They heard the sound of the **LORD God walking** in the garden”* (Gen. 3:8), it is not teaching that God literally has feet and makes footstep noises. Rather, it’s a narrative way of saying God’s presence was manifest in the Garden. God is by nature spirit (John 4:24) and omnipresent – He doesn’t *need* to walk to get somewhere, nor does He have a physical body (before the Incarnation of Christ). Similarly, verses about God’s “hands” or “eyes” (e.g. *“the eyes of the Lord roam to and fro…,”* 2 Chr. 16:9) convey His actions or awareness, not that He has eyeballs or arms of flesh. The Bible itself **warns us not to take such language in a crude, literal way**: *“God is not a man, that He should lie; nor a son of man, that He should change His mind”* (Numbers 23:19). And after listing many anthropomorphic descriptions of God, Scripture then clearly states, *“**He** is **Spirit**”* and *“the King eternal, immortal, **invisible**”* (John 4:24, 1 Timothy 1:17). In fact, when people started to imagine God as literally like a human idol, the prophets sharply rebuked them. Psalm 50:21 is one striking example where God says to those who misunderstood Him: *“You thought that I was one like yourself. But now I rebuke you.”*. The Apostle Paul in Athens likewise corrected the idea that the divine nature is anything material: *“We ought not to think that the Divine Being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man”* (Acts 17:29). In short, **the Bible uses analogies and accommodations** to communicate about God, but it simultaneously teaches God’s **infinite difference** from us in His being.

Why use these human-like descriptions at all? Because it’s the only way to communicate with us finite humans about God’s actions and character. We understand concepts like love, anger, walking, seeing – so Scripture says God “loves,” God’s “anger” was kindled, God “walked” or “spoke” etc., to **illustrate real truths** (God *does* love; God *does* respond with righteous displeasure to evil; God *does* take action in history). But Christian theology clarifies that *when* such terms are used, they are **analogical**. That means they are partly similar and partly dissimilar to what we experience. For example, our anger is a passion that flares up and can be petty or out-of-control; God’s “anger,” by contrast, is a perfectly just opposition to sin, not a fit of irrational rage. God’s “fatherhood” is like a human father’s love, but far beyond in perfection (see Jesus’ comparison in Matthew 7:11). We must **interpret Scripture with Scripture**, as the Reformers said: verses that say *“God repented”* or *“God was grieved”* are understood in light of verses that affirm His unchanging nature and perfect knowledge (e.g. 1 Samuel 15:29, James 1:17). The early Church fathers and later theologians often explained that God accommodates our understanding, “lisping” to us as a parent does to a child. They coined terms like *anthropopatheia* for when divine Scripture speaks in a human mode. As long ago as the 4th century, St. Augustine noted that when the Bible says *God’s hand* or *God’s wrath*, we should filter it through what we know clearly: that God is spirit and unchangeable. The physical or emotional imagery teaches us something true *in an analogical way* – for instance, “God’s mighty arm” signifies His power to act in the world, “God’s anger” signifies His justice toward wrongdoing, and so on.

Therefore, to claim “Christians believe God is literally a bearded man with mood swings” is a straw man. No orthodox Christian denomination teaches that. We believe God is *personal* (not an abstract force) and capable of relationship – thus He can be called Father, and we can grieve His Spirit (Ephesians 4:30) – but we also maintain He is *perfect* and not subject to sinful passions or ignorance as we are. Theologians express this by saying God’s attributes (like love, justice, mercy) are exercised *without imperfection*. When Scripture says *“God was angry,”* it is telling us that God responded to sin as a perfectly just judge would – not that He lost His temper uncontrollably. In fact, the Bible often uses **literary devices** like anthropomorphism to *help* us, not to confuse us. They invite us to understand aspects of God’s character by analogy to human experience, while the broader biblical witness makes clear God is **far greater** than these analogies. This helps prevent us from making literal idols in our minds. As one Bible scholar put it: *“When God is described in human terms…they are not to be interpreted in a literal fashion. Scripture reveals that God is spirit… Hence, it is wrong to think of God as a physical being or as having physical parts.”*.

One example: Genesis says God “walked” in the garden and later “came down” to see the Tower of Babel (Gen. 11:5). Does God actually need to *“come down”* to learn what humans are doing? No – the Bible elsewhere says God is omniscient, knowing everything already (Psalm 139, Hebrews 4:13). The phrase “the Lord came down” is a subtle ironic way to say, *from God’s perspective the grand Tower of Man was so puny He had to ‘descend’ to get a look!* It underscores God’s superiority, not literal travel. Likewise, when Exodus 4:14 says God’s anger “burned” against Moses, it communicates God’s serious displeasure at Moses’ disobedience, not a physical change in God. We use similar metaphors even in human matters (“she was *burning* with anger” – no one thinks actual fire is involved).

In sum, **Christians do not believe God is a man or a cosmic grandpa**. Any depictions of God with a body (like Michaelangelo’s famous Sistine Chapel painting of God as a bearded man) are understood as artistic symbolism, not literal theology. We affirm, with Scripture, that God’s being is **infinitely higher** than ours: *“For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, declares the LORD. As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways”* (Isaiah 55:8–9). When atheists quote a verse about God’s “anger” or a story of divine judgment and then say “Look, God is temperamental and cruel, like a tyrant,” they are often imposing a very crude interpretation that ignores context and genre. A fair approach would ask *what do Christians actually understand these passages to mean* in light of the whole Bible and Christian tradition. The answer usually is: *We understand them in a nuanced way, consistent with God’s perfect goodness and immaterial nature.*

Incidentally, even **devout believers** can fall into subtly imagining God in an overly human way. We might subconsciously picture God as an old man with a certain face, or think of His love as just a slightly bigger version of human love, or His rule as like a bigger king. We have to continually remind ourselves that **God is in a category of His own**. Any time we say “God is *like*…,” the likeness is limited. As theologian *David Bentley Hart* points out, the God of classical theism *“is not an item within the universe… not simply some craftsman who creates by manipulating materials external to himself, not composed of parts, but rather residing in all things while remaining perfectly one”*. When we keep this majestic view in mind, it actually deepens our worship. It also reassures us: for example, understanding God’s transcendence (He’s all-powerful and all-knowing) helps us trust His promises, while understanding His immanence (He cares for us intimately) keeps us from thinking He’s too lofty to notice us. **Maintaining the balance** is key. God declares *“I dwell in the high and holy place, and also with him who is of a contrite and lowly spirit”* (Isaiah 57:15). He is both greater than we can imagine *and* closer than we can dream.

## **Moving from Caricature to Reality**

Throughout this session, our aim has been to replace caricatures of God with a clearer picture of what Christians actually believe. Skeptics, if they wish to critique belief in God, owe it to themselves to **engage the real arguments and definitions** rather than mock a cartoon. It’s striking that some of the New Atheist writers, like Dawkins, seem to have assumed a very *crude notion of God* (basically a superhuman being within the universe) and then easily dismissed it. But as we’ve seen, this misses the target by a wide margin. One journalist, after reviewing a book on classical theology, remarked that atheists who ignore the true concept of God are *“failing to contend with what, in both historical and philosophical terms, theism really is – as opposed to the patently silly straw man they clearly prefer it to be.”* In other words, to fairly reject something, you must first understand it. Just as we’d insist a critic of physics learn actual physics (not comic-book physics) before passing judgment, we encourage critics of Christianity to at least grasp the classical idea of God before claiming victory over “belief in God.” Intellectual honesty demands that we address our opponents’ strongest case, not a weak parody of it.

On the positive side, when we clear away the straw men, the real vision of God in Christianity is immensely richer and more compelling than the caricatures. God is not a temperamental tyrant or a distant deity – He is *the fullness of Being*, the source of all beauty, truth, and goodness, who freely chose to create out of love. The classical Christian God is the one *“in whom we live and move and have our being”* (Acts 17:28), yet who also **loves each of us personally** and revealed Himself supremely in Jesus Christ. This paradox of transcendence and immanence sets the God of the Bible apart from any pagan gods or imaginary friends. He’s not just a regional deity or a figment of wishful thinking; He is the **necessary Reality** underlying everything, who also enters into covenant with humans. Understanding this helps us answer many skeptical challenges more effectively. For instance, when someone says “Belief in God is like believing in the Tooth Fairy,” we can respond: *No, the concepts are utterly different.* The Tooth Fairy (or Santa) is a finite, material being within the world, for whom no serious philosophical argument or worldwide consensus exists – and indeed, we have strong evidence those are make-believe (we eventually catch parents in the act, etc.). God, on the other hand, is an infinite, transcendent being and the very ground of existence. The types of evidence we’d expect for God are different from those for Santa. (As one writer humorously noted, there *is* evidence of Santa – gifts under the tree – but we have much more evidence *against* Santa, like parents confessing and NORAD failing to actually spot him. The Santa hypothesis fails by its own predictions. By contrast, the God hypothesis concerns why **anything** exists and the existence of consciousness, moral law, etc., and it hasn’t been falsified – in fact many would argue there is strong evidence **for** it.) In short, believing in the God of classical theism is a robust intellectual stance held by many of the greatest minds in history – not at all equivalent to childish belief in a fairy tale.

Finally, reflecting on **our own misconceptions** is important too. Even as believers who affirm all these lofty truths, we might sometimes catch ourselves treating God as if He were “too small.” For example, in prayer we might doubt God’s power to really change a situation (forgetting He is omnipotent), or we might treat Him like a mere problem-solver or genie, only running to Him for fixes (forgetting He is Lord of all and worthy of worship regardless). Alternatively, we might emotionally picture God as distant or uninvolved in our day-to-day concerns (forgetting that He knows us better than we know ourselves and invites us to cast every care on Him). The Bible corrects both extremes: God is *infinitely exalted*, yet *intimately present*. Isaiah 55:8–9 (mentioned above) reminds us not to project our limits onto God – His wisdom and plans far exceed ours. Yet Jesus also tells us that God cares for the sparrows and even numbers the hairs on our head (Luke 12:6-7). So we must avoid bringing God “down to our level” in a way that diminishes His majesty, **and** avoid pushing Him so far away that we forget His compassion. A balanced, biblical view of God’s nature – *transcendent Creator and loving Father* – will deepen our faith and trust. It helps us combat doubts, because we remember that the true God is not limited like the false images critics mock. When someone ridicules “God” as cruel, or petty, or imaginary, we can inwardly say, “That’s not *my* God they’re describing.” And we can humbly offer to share what the Christian understanding of God really is, in hopes that honest seekers will at least be rejecting (or perhaps **embracing**) the real thing and not a parody.

In closing, dispelling these myths is not about “winning arguments” but about **clarifying truth**. We want our friends (and ourselves) to encounter God as He really is – not a cartoonish straw man, but the living, holy, and loving God revealed in Scripture and ultimately in Christ. Ridicule is a poor substitute for understanding. By patiently clearing up misconceptions, we create room for genuine dialogue. Someone who thought God was just a fairy tale might, upon hearing the *actual* concept, say, “Hmm, I never heard it explained that way.” That moment of understanding is a win, whether or not they immediately agree. At least now the conversation is about the real God and not an “invisible sky fairy.” As we proceed, let’s encourage intellectual fairness and spiritual openness: **seek the truth about God, and be willing to question caricatures – both others’ and our own.** We believe that when one does earnestly seek, they will find not a fairy or an old man in the sky, but the magnificent reality of God who *“is light; in Him is no darkness at all”* (1 John 1:5).

## Discussion Questions

* What are some depictions or arguments about God you’ve encountered from skeptics or in popular culture? Did those accurately represent the God you know from Scripture, or were they straw man portrayals?
* Why do you think caricatures of God (e.g. an angry tyrant, or a mythical “sky fairy”) persist in modern discourse? How can we gently correct these misunderstandings among our friends, or even in our own thinking?
* How would you respond to a friend who says, “Believing in God is like believing in the Tooth Fairy or Santa Claus”? What key differences would you point out?
* The question “If God created the universe, who created God?” comes up a lot. Based on what we discussed, how would you answer it in simple terms?
* In what ways might *we* as Christians sometimes imagine God too narrowly or in human terms (for example, only turning to Him as a last resort, or assuming He is on “our side” against others as if He were a tribal deity)? How does maintaining a proper, exalted view of God’s nature – **and** remembering His personal love – help strengthen our faith and correct our attitudes?

## Recommended Reading

* **Alvin Plantinga – “The Dawkins Confusion” (article).** A sharp and insightful review of Richard Dawkins’ *The God Delusion* by a leading Christian philosopher. Plantinga points out logical flaws in Dawkins’ critique, especially how Dawkins attacks a very crude notion of God. For example, Plantinga notes Dawkins mistakenly treats God as a complex physical object and ignores the classical idea of divine *simplicity*, and he highlights Dawkins’ inconsistent reasoning about improbability. This article is readable and thoughtfully dismantles the straw men in Dawkins’ arguments.

* **C.S. Lewis – *Mere Christianity*, Book II, Chapter 1: “The Rival Conceptions of God.”** In this chapter (originally a radio talk), Lewis distinguishes between different ideas of God found in the world – from pantheism to dualism to the Christian view. He explains why not all “gods” are the same, and uses analogies like arithmetic (there’s one right answer, though some wrong answers are closer than others). This helps in explaining why believing in the Christian God is not like believing in just any myth. Notably, Lewis addresses the difference between a mere life-force or impersonal god and the **personal God** Christians believe in. It’s a great, lay-friendly way to clarify what Christians do *not* believe about God, as well as what we do believe.

* **Edward Feser – *Five Proofs of the Existence of God*, Introduction.** Philosopher Edward Feser provides a modern defense of classical arguments for God. In the introduction, he emphasizes understanding what we *mean* by “God” in these proofs, so that atheists and theists aren’t talking past each other. He briefly addresses common objections (like “Who made God?” or “Isn’t this just a god of the gaps?”) and shows why those miss the point when we grasp the classical theist definition of God. Feser’s writing is clear and accessible, making ancient arguments (from Aristotle, Plotinus, Aquinas, etc.) understandable today. This intro sets the stage by clearing away caricatures and establishing the **classical attributes of God** (such as being the uncaused cause, eternal, simple, etc.), which is crucial for any meaningful debate.

* **R.C. Sproul – *The Character of God* (video series or booklet).** R.C. Sproul was a renowned Bible teacher in the Reformed tradition, noted for making theology understandable. In *The Character of God*, Sproul walks through God’s attributes (holiness, sovereignty, omniscience, etc.) in a very pastoral and engaging way. Along the journey, he often tackles popular misunderstandings – like the notion that God is “just like us but bigger.” Sproul reminds us that God’s holiness means He is in a class by Himself, not measured on our scale. One memorable quote from Sproul (echoed by others) is that God isn’t simply at the **top** of the being “chain of life” – *He’s on an entirely different chain* (indeed, the Creator *outside* the chain!). This resource will enrich your awe of God and equip you to answer misconceptions by pointing people to Scripture’s full portrait of the Almighty.

*(These readings reinforce session 2’s theme by addressing misunderstandings at both the scholarly and popular level. Plantinga directly refutes a leading atheist’s straw men; Lewis uses analogy to clarify the Christian concept of God; Feser provides philosophical depth on what we mean by “God”; Sproul brings it home devotionally, correcting the idea that God is just a bigger human. Together, they’ll help you engage skeptics with clarity and strengthen your own understanding.)*
