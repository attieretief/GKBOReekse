# Grounding Our Worldview: A Metaphysical Exploration of God

# Session 1: Defining “God” in Classical Theism

## 1. Summary

David Bentley Hart’s lecture (based on his book *The Experience of God: Being, Consciousness, Bliss*) invites us to rethink what we **mean by “God”** in the classical theistic tradition. In classical theism – a view shared historically by Christians like Augustine and Aquinas, as well as by Jewish, Islamic, and even some Eastern thinkers – “God” does not refer to a *finite being* or just a powerful entity somewhere in the universe. Rather, God is understood as **the infinite source and ground of all reality**. Hart emphasizes that God is *“the infinite fullness of being, omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient, from whom all things come and upon whom all things depend for every moment of their existence”*. In other words, everything that exists is continually contingent on God, *“in whom we live and move and have our being”* (Acts 17:28). This means God is not one being *among others* but the very **act of Being itself** that sustains all things. Classical theologians like St. Thomas Aquinas expressed this by saying God’s essence *is* existence (He is *ipsum esse subsistens*, “subsistent being itself”).

Hart points out that many modern atheists miss this classical concept. They attack a caricature of God – imagining God as a superhuman sky-dweller or an item *within* the universe – what Hart calls a *“demiurgic god”* (a kind of cosmic craftsman). But rejecting such a being **does not actually address** the God that classical theism affirms. Hart quips that even if some powerful cosmic creator “named ‘God’” existed yet *was himself a being dependent on some deeper explanation*, the **“village atheist”** could still ask *“Who made that god?”*. The true God of classical theism, by contrast, is *not* an object that needs a cause or context—God is the **uncaused Reality** upon which *everything else* depends. As Hart summarizes: *“God is not some discrete being out there… Rather, he is himself the logical order of all reality, the ground of both the subjective rationality of mind and the objective rationality of being”*. In simpler terms, God is the **Reason** why anything exists or makes sense at all – the one in whom minds and matter alike “participate” to have being and order.

To clarify this idea, Hart’s talk (and book) is structured around three foundational **aspects of reality** – *Being, Consciousness,* and *Bliss* – which he argues all point toward God. He shows that a theistic worldview better **explains these fundamental experiences** than a strictly materialist or naturalist view. Below is a brief summary of each aspect, enriched with insights from other thinkers:

* **Being (Existence itself):** Why is there *something* rather than nothing? Hart argues that the sheer *“thereness”* of existence – the fact that anything exists at all – is a signpost toward God. All finite things depend on an *ultimate ground* of existence. Classical Christian theology has long taught that God alone exists by nature, whereas creatures exist *by God’s continual gift*. St. Thomas Aquinas, for example, taught that creatures have only “participated being,” whereas God **is** Being in Himself. In Exodus 3:14 God reveals His name to Moses as “I **AM** WHO I AM,” which the Church has read as God identifying Himself with *eternal Being* (the Greek Old Testament renders it as *“He Who Is”*). Accordingly, Hart reminds us that God is *“perfect actuality and fullness of being”*, the **necessary being** who gives existence to all contingent beings. Atheistic naturalism, on the other hand, tends to take for granted that the universe just exists. Classical theists like Aquinas or Augustine find that unsatisfying – **being itself** demands a deeper explanation. Hart (along with philosophers like Aristotle and Leibniz) would say there must be an ultimate, uncaused reality that holds everything in existence. In Hart’s words, without the infinite God, *“nothing at all could exist”*. Christian philosopher William Lane Craig makes a similar point in his cosmological argument: if the universe began to exist, its cause must be a **transcendent, necessary being** beyond space and time – which is essentially what classical theism means by God.

* **Consciousness (Mind and Awareness):** We experience not only an ordered world, but also our own interior life of mind, reason, and will. Hart contends that *consciousness* – especially our capacities for rational thought, self-awareness, and knowing truth – cannot be adequately explained by pure material processes. Our subjective experience (the reality of mind, or “qualia” and intentionality) points to a source beyond mere matter. Here Hart’s argument aligns with a long line of thinkers: **Plato** believed that timeless truths (like mathematics or justice) suggest a reality of Mind or Logos behind the physical world, and **Aristotle** concluded there must be a *prime intellect* (an Unmoved Mover) which is *Thought thinking itself*. In Christian tradition, the Gospel of John opens by identifying God as the *Logos* (“Word” or Reason) through whom all things were made. Hart similarly asserts that God is *“infinite consciousness”* – the **perfect mind** that is the source of all rational minds. He humorously dismisses attempts to reduce consciousness to computation, noting that *“software no more ‘thinks’ than a clock’s minute hand knows the time”*. No arrangement of purely physical parts explains *why* we have first-person awareness or abstract reasoning. Instead, our rationality and inner life make sense if reality itself is grounded in a supreme **Intellect**. Even Alvin Plantinga, a prominent analytic philosopher, has argued that if our minds were merely products of mindless evolution, we’d have little reason to trust our reasoning at all – implying that a **divine Mind** undergirds the reliability of human cognition. In short, Hart uses the mystery of consciousness as evidence that *“the ultimate coincidence and fullness of being and consciousness”* meet in God.

* **Bliss (Longing for the Good, True, and Beautiful):** Humans universally yearn for meaning, goodness, **moral truth**, and beauty. Hart uses the term *“Bliss”* (echoing the Sanskrit *ananda*, meaning supreme happiness) to describe the **fulfillment** that our minds and hearts naturally seek. We have an innate “restless” desire for something ultimate – for enduring truth, perfect goodness, and transcendent beauty. Classical theology interprets this as a built-in orientation toward God, the supreme Truth, Goodness, and Beauty. St. Augustine famously prayed, *“You have made us for Yourself, O Lord, and **our heart is restless until it rests in You**”*. Hart echoes this, observing that even those who don’t profess religion still have *“a natural longing for God”* whenever they earnestly seek truth or do good. He argues that if the world were only matter, our relentless hunger for transcendent ideals would be inexplicable (a mere evolutionary quirk at best). But if God is real, our desires make sense – they are signposts toward our *true fulfillment in the infinite*. Hart notes, for instance, that we recognize and cherish **Beauty** in a way far beyond survival utility. Beauty often moves us deeply for no pragmatic reason, *“gloriously useless”* in Hart’s words – yet we feel it points to *“a fuller beauty”* beyond the imperfect things we see. The Christian vision affirms this: all created beauties and joys are reflections of God’s own perfection, meant to draw us toward Him. Moreover, our sense of **moral duty** and longing for justice point to a source of absolute Good. Hart is blunt that a purely materialist view fails to provide any objective foundation for morality or meaning. In contrast, if God is the *Good itself*, then our moral convictions are grounded in reality, and our desire to do good is indeed *“a confession”* of our desire for God. Philosophers like **Alvin Plantinga** and **C.S. Lewis** have made similar arguments: if we find in ourselves a desire that nothing in the material world can satisfy, it suggests we are made for something beyond the material – ultimately, for fellowship with God (the source of true blessedness).

In summary, Hart’s talk guides us to see “God” not as an abstract idea nor a competing object in the universe, but as **the One ultimate reality** that is the source of all existence, intellect, and goodness. This classical idea of God (the “God of classical theism”) is shared across many theistic traditions. It undergirds the Christian confession of God as the **Creator** of all things, in whom all things hold together. By drawing on first principles of being, consciousness, and our innate longing for the transcendent, Hart shows that belief in God is deeply rational and coherent. It is, as one reviewer put it, a vision of God as *“the infinite fullness of being… and infinite consciousness, infinite bliss, in whom we find our only true consummation”*. This God is not remote or impersonal; rather, He is **Reality itself**, *“transcendent and indwelling”* at the same time – nearer to us than we are to ourselves, yet beyond our comprehension. Hart’s classical presentation thus challenges us to enrich our understanding of the divine, moving beyond simplistic pictures and appreciating the profound mystery captured in Scripture: *“In Him we live and move and have our being.”*

## 2. A Structured Logical Flow from First Principles

Let’s break down the **logical reasoning** behind classical theism step by step, starting from basic first principles. How do thinkers like Hart (along with Augustine, Aquinas, and others) reason their way *to* the concept of God? We can outline it in three fundamental steps, corresponding to *Being*, *Consciousness*, and *Bliss*:

### **a. Why Something Exists: The Question of *Being***

1. **Principle of Sufficient Reason:** First, consider that **something exists** rather than nothing – the universe, with all its contingent things, is here. Classical reasoning (going back to Plato and Aristotle, and later Aquinas and Leibniz) holds that every contingent thing requires an explanation or cause. The universe consists of things that **begin, change, and depend** on other things. It’s natural to ask: *Why is there a universe at all?* Why does anything exist instead of nothing?

2. **Contingency and Necessary Being:** Upon reflection, anything that *might not* have existed (for example, you and I, the earth, stars, etc.) is **contingent** – its existence is not self-explanatory. If we trace back chains of causes or conditions, classical thinkers argue we can’t have an infinite regress of contingent explanations; there must be something that exists *in its own right*, not dependent on anything else. In other words, there must be at least one **necessary being** that provides the ultimate explanation for the existence of all contingent beings. This necessary reality would have no external cause and cannot *not* exist – it exists by its very nature.

3. **God as the Ground of Being:** Classical theism identifies this necessary, self-existent reality as **God**. God is the *ultimate ground of being* that gives existence to everything else. This isn’t just an arbitrary label; it fits with how God revealed Himself in Scripture. When Moses asked God’s name, God responded, *“I AM WHO I AM”* (Exodus 3:14), implying **self-existence**. As Aquinas explains, *“He Who Is”* is a most proper name for God, because it signifies that God’s very **essence is existence** itself. All other beings only *have* existence by participation; God *is* existence. St. Augustine similarly taught that God is *“that which truly IS”*, and that everything else is *less real* by comparison since created things come and go. Thus, from the **first principle of existence**, we arrive at a God who is not one being among many, but *Being-itself*, the inexhaustible **Act of To-Be**. This answers the question of why anything exists: all things exist because they receive being continuously from the Creator. As the Apostle Paul preached, *“He himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything”* (Acts 17:25) – *“for **in Him** we live and move and have our being”* (Acts 17:28). John Calvin, commenting on that verse, wrote that *“in speaking properly \[God] alone is,”* and *“it belongs to God alone to be, \[while] all other things have their being in Him”*. In short, **God alone exists of Himself**, and everything else exists **through Him**. This line of reasoning from being (often called the *cosmological* or *contingency argument*) gives us a foundation: any coherent worldview needs an ultimate uncaused Reality. Classical theism asserts that this ultimate Reality is a transcendent, intelligent, and good Creator – a conclusion supported as we consider consciousness and moral aspirations next.

### **b. Why Minds Exist: The Insight of *Consciousness***

1. **Matter vs. Mind:** We also recognize a fundamental difference between **material objects** and our own **minds**. Atoms and molecules by themselves have no interior life or purpose; they just follow physical laws. Yet here we are – conscious beings with **thoughts, emotions, will, and rational insight**. How did mind arise from matter? A strict materialist might claim that mind *“emerged”* from complex biological processes, but classical thinkers find this inadequate. There is an explanatory gap between unconscious matter and the first-person experience of consciousness.

2. **The Intelligibility of Reality:** Moreover, we find that reality is **intelligible** – it can be understood by mind – and we possess the **intelligence** to do so. We can discern logical and mathematical truths that seem to have a timeless, objective character (2+2=4, the laws of logic, etc.), and we naturally assume that our reason can grasp real truth about the world. If the universe were ultimately mindless, it’s puzzling *why* it would consistently follow rational laws or why our minds would reliably correspond to those laws. (Why should a purely accidental cosmos be so orderly and mathematically elegant?)

3. **God as Supreme Mind (Logos):** From these considerations, classical theism infers that the ultimate cause of the world must include **Mind or Reason** – that the universe is grounded in *intelligence* rather than blind chaos. **God**, as the tradition holds, is *intellectual and spiritual* in nature – “infinite consciousness,” as Hart says. The Gospel of John calls God the *Logos*, meaning *Divine Reason*. The idea is that our finite minds can grasp truth because they are made in the image of the **Divine Mind** that structured reality. *“In your light do we see light,”* says Psalm 36:9, implying that our knowing is a participation in God’s knowing. St. Augustine taught that unchanging truths (like the laws of logic) are grounded in God’s eternal truth – *“Where I found truth, there I found my God, the Truth itself,”* he wrote. Similarly, philosopher Alvin Plantinga has argued that **logical and moral laws** make the most sense if there is a supreme personal Mind in whom those principles ultimately reside (otherwise, we’re left with abstract absolutes with no foundation). In practical terms, when we engage in reasoning or recognize something as true, we are implicitly relying on a rational order that *transcends* the material world. Classical theists identify that order with God’s wisdom. As Hart puts it, God is *“the ground of the subjective rationality of mind and the objective rationality of being”* – the *Reason* that connects our minds to the world.

4. **The Imago Dei (Image of God):** The human mind itself – with its capacities for **self-awareness, free will, creativity, and love** – is seen as evidence of a divine origin. It is hard to imagine that valueless, mindless processes would accidentally produce beings capable of science, art, and moral reflection. C.S. Lewis humorously noted that if our thoughts are merely atoms colliding, we have no reason to trust them as true – thus undermining materialism itself. Hart systematically dismantles “reductionist” views of consciousness, pointing out phenomena like **qualia** (subjective feel of experiences), **abstract reasoning**, and **intentionality** (the mind’s about-ness or ability to refer to things) – none of which are explainable by physics alone. These facets of mind *“ought to give even the most convinced materialists pause”*. The more reasonable inference is that *Mind comes from a greater Mind*. As the biblical book of Genesis suggests, we are creatures made “in the image of God” (Genesis 1:27), meaning our personal capacities reflect, in a finite way, the **personal nature of our Creator**. Far from the universe being an accident, our conscious minds point to a **conscious Creator** who intended rational, relational beings to arise. God is thus not an impersonal force but has attributes of personality (intellect and will) to an infinite, perfect degree. That is why classical theism comfortably calls God *Father*, or love, or truth, without implying He’s a literal human – He is the *source* of all personal qualities in creatures. (That said, classical theologians caution that God is still *beyond* our human categories – God is not *a* person in exactly the way we are, but something infinitely greater, of which our personhood is a finite reflection.)

5. **Summary of the Logic:** From the existence of **conscious minds** and intelligibility, the logical flow is: if reason and personality are real features of our world, their ultimate cause must have at least as much rationality and personal agency – as Jesus said, *“That which is born of Spirit is spirit”* (John 3:6). Thus, the first principle of **Mind** leads to God as the **Supreme Mind**. This dovetails with the earlier conclusion that God is the necessary Being – we now see this necessary being must also be *smart* (indeed omniscient) and *intentional*, not a blind force. The world is not a random accident; it’s more like a **creative expression of an intelligence**. Or as classical philosophers would say, *the First Cause is also the Supreme Logos*.

### **c. Why We Long for More: The Pointer of *Bliss (Goodness and Beauty)***

1. **Human Longing:** Humans are driven by a search for meaning, purpose, and fulfillment. We have deep **moral convictions** – a sense of right and wrong – and we appreciate **beauty** and **love**. We also have a kind of “infinite” desire: no matter how much we achieve or experience, we sense that our hearts want something *enduring* and *ultimate*. (As Ecclesiastes 3:11 puts it, God “set eternity in the human heart.”) Where does this urge for the **Absolute** come from?

2. **Moral Truth and the Good:** If one denies God, one must say that moral values and human purpose are subjective by-products of evolution or society. Yet most people feel that things like justice, love, honesty, and mercy are *really* meaningful – that, for example, love is **better** than hate, objectively. Classical theism provides a ground for that belief: God’s nature is the **ultimate Good**, and the moral law is an expression of that nature. That’s why, when we do good or witness goodness, it resonates deeply with us – we are aligning with the grain of reality. Hart argues that even secular people’s sincere ethical striving is effectively *“a natural longing for God”*, the source of all goodness. Philosophers in the Platonic tradition have often said that **Goodness Itself** (what Plato called “the Form of the Good”) is indistinguishable from God. Christianity goes a step further: *“God is love”* (1 John 4:8) – the personal Good who created us out of love. Thus any true act of love or pursuit of virtue in this life is a participation in God’s life. Our conscience and our aspirations to goodness testify that we are made in the image of a perfectly Good Creator. This is sometimes called the **moral argument** for God’s existence – without God, moral truths would have no firm foundation, but with God, right and wrong have an eternal basis in His character.

3. **Beauty and Joy:** Likewise, our appreciation for **beauty** – whether in nature, art, music, or relationships – consistently points beyond itself. A beautiful sunset moves us, not because it’s useful for survival, but because it seems to **manifest a glory** or points to a joy beyond words. Hart calls beauty “gloriously useless” – meaning it’s valuable *in itself*, a faint experience of a **higher beauty**. This aligns with a classical view: God is the source of all beauty, and the joy we get from beautiful things is ultimately a desire for union with the **source of all beauty**, which is God. As the Psalms say, *“Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness”* (Psalm 29:2) and *“One thing I seek… to behold the beauty of the Lord”* (Psalm 27:4). The fact that beauty *gives* us bliss hints that we are not just clever apes; we are **seekers of transcendence**. Christians believe this is because we are created to enjoy the beauty of God forever. In this life, every beautiful moment or true joy is like a **signpost or appetizer** for that ultimate happiness (what Hart refers to by “Bliss”).

4. **Teleology – We Are Drawn to God:** Hart notes that human consciousness is inherently **teleological** – it’s oriented toward goals or ends beyond itself. We hunger not only for daily bread, but for meaning, truth, and permanence. If the universe were impersonal and purposeless, such relentless aspiration in us would be very strange. But if **God is real**, it makes sense that we would have a built-in *“homing instinct”* for God. Saint Augustine described this eloquently in his *Confessions*: *“You have made us for Yourself, and our heart is restless until it rests in You.”* Our restlessness for more – for a joy that doesn’t fade – is itself a clue pointing to God. It’s as if we remember, at some deep level, that we come from the Infinite Good and are made to return to Him. This is why worldly successes never fully satisfy; we always want *more*, or something *eternal*. Classical Christian authors like Augustine and Pascal observed that nothing but **God** can fill the “God-shaped vacuum” in man’s heart.

5. **Conclusion from Desire:** This line of reasoning (sometimes called the **argument from desire**) concludes that *for every natural, innate human desire, there corresponds something real that can satisfy it*. We have hunger – there is food. We thirst – there is water. We feel loneliness – there is friendship and love. We long for unending joy and perfect love – therefore, many have argued, **there must be a reality (God) that can satisfy this longing**. If we find ourselves with a desire that nothing in time or on earth can meet, it suggests we were made for eternity and for God’s presence. Hart’s emphasis on “Bliss” integrates this idea: our **rational appetites for truth and goodness** are oriented toward the infinite (truth itself, goodness itself). Thus, human experience taken at face value – rather than pointing *away* from God, as skeptics might think – actually **points toward God** at every turn. Being, mind, and desire each serve like *bright arrows* on the road, all converging on the same destination: the infinite, self-sustaining, supremely conscious and loving **God** of classical theism.

By following this logical flow from first principles, we see a coherent picture emerge. Classical theism isn’t built on one narrow argument; it arises from seeing how **all roads lead to God**. Existence needs a ground (God the Creator), reason needs a source (God the Logos), and our longing needs fulfilment (God the Good). In a sense, this mirrors Acts 17:27-28, where Paul told the Athenians that God made us *“that we should seek God, in the hope that we might feel after him and find him – yet he is actually not far from each one of us”*, for we live and move in Him. The classical view is that God is both transcendent (beyond the world as its source) and immanent (present to everything as its sustainer). He’s the answer to the deepest why at every level. All of reality, from the fact it exists at all to the highest aspirations of the human spirit, “whispers” or even “shouts” to us about God’s presence and glory.

## 3. Notable Quotations from Hart and Other Thinkers

To enrich our understanding, here are some **memorable quotes** from David Bentley Hart and other relevant voices, each shedding light on God in classical theism:

* **David Bentley Hart (Orthodox theologian)** – *“God is not, in any of the great theistic traditions, merely some rational agent, external to the order of the physical universe… He is not some discrete being somewhere out there… Rather, **he is himself the logical order of all reality, the ground both of the subjective rationality of mind and the objective rationality of being**.”*

* **David Bentley Hart** – (on the misguided atheist caricatures of God) *“Hurling flak at a deity who inhabits the same circle of existence as everything else is fair game – but it isn’t significant with regards to **the God… who is the independent Source of all contingent being**. Confronted by so constrained a concept of God, the village atheist can still ask, *‘Who made God?’*”*

* **St. Thomas Aquinas (13th c. theologian)** – *“All things that exist, exist by having being. A thing whose essence is not its own being exists only by participation in something else – namely, in **Being itself**. But the first cause (God), having nothing prior to Him, must have as His essence **His very act of being**… Thus when God told Moses ‘I AM WHO I AM’ (Exod. 3:14), He revealed **His proper name** to be ‘He Who Is’.”*

* **St. Augustine of Hippo (4th c.)** – *“Where I have found **Truth**, there I have found my God, the Truth itself.”* (Augustine correlates God with ultimate truth and reality.)

* **St. Augustine** – *“You have made us for Yourself, O Lord, and **our heart is restless until it rests in You**.”* (Confessions, opening paragraph.)

* **John Calvin (16th c. Reformer)** – *“There is within the human mind, and indeed by natural instinct, **an awareness of divinity**. God Himself has implanted in all men a certain understanding of His divine majesty.”* (Institutes of the Christian Religion, I.3.1, on the innate *sensus divinitatis* in every person.)

* **John Calvin** – *“In Him we live and move and have our being” – Paul’s meaning is that we are in a manner contained in God’s power… *for **it belongs to God alone to BE; all other things have their being in Him***.”* (Commentary on Acts 17, highlighting God’s self-existence and sustaining presence.)

* **Alvin Plantinga (21st c. philosopher)** – *“**God is defined as a maximally great being**, i.e., a being that has all qualities that would make Him maximally great. One quality such a being must have is **necessary existence**. A ‘God’ who could *not* exist or could be one among others would not be maximally great.”* (Plantinga’s modal logic framing of God’s nature.)

* **C.S. Lewis (20th c. author)** – *“If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that **I was made for another world**.”* (From *Mere Christianity*. Not a classical theologian per se, but here Lewis echoes the classical idea of our natural desire for God.)

* **Edward Feser (Thomistic philosopher)** – *“The classical theist starts from the idea that God is **that reality which is absolutely ultimate or fundamental, the source of all other reality**… He is not ‘a being’ alongside other beings; rather, **His essence just is existence**… He does not *have* intellect and will; rather He just **is** infinite intellect and will.”*

Each of these quotations reinforces aspects of the classical understanding of God: as the **self-existent source** of all being (Aquinas, Calvin, Feser), as the **truth and goodness itself** that our hearts seek (Augustine, Lewis), and as the **necessary, maximally perfect being** beyond whom none greater can be conceived (Plantinga, and Anselm’s idea implicitly in Feser’s note). Taken together, they draw our attention to the grandeur of God in classical theism – **infinite, uncaused, unchanging, yet the personal foundation of everything we know**.

## 4. Discussion Questions

Let’s reflect on these concepts with some discussion. In your small group, consider these questions. (There are no “exam” answers expected – these are prompts to get us thinking and talking openly about our understanding of God.)

* **God Beyond the Sky:** Before this talk and reading, how did you conceive of “God”? Did you tend to think of God as a specific being *within* the universe (even a very powerful one)? How does the classical view – God as the *ground* of all being – compare to your earlier understanding?

* **“Who Made God?”:** A common challenge is *“If everything needs a cause, who caused God?”* How does the classical definition of God (as the one necessary being who simply IS, and thus doesn’t need a cause) answer this question? Do you find that answer satisfying? Why or why not?

* **Living in God’s Presence:** Acts 17:28 says, *“In Him we live and move and have our being.”* What do you think it means to *exist in God*? In day-to-day life, do you sense that dependence on God’s presence? How might our perspective on ordinary things change if we really believe *all* existence is sustained by God moment-to-moment?

* **Mind and Meaning:** Hart and others argue that our ability to reason and seek truth points to God’s intellect. Have you ever thought of **consciousness or reason** as clues to God’s existence? Why might a purely material universe struggle to produce beings who search for truth, meaning, and morality? Can you think of examples where your own rational or moral experience felt like *“more than atoms”*?

* **Desire for God:** Augustine’s quote about our hearts being restless until they rest in God is famous. Have you experienced this *“restlessness”* or a sense of something missing, even when life is going well? In what ways do people try to satisfy this longing with other things? If our deepest longings are actually for God (truth, love, beauty in an infinite sense), how might that influence our approach to prayer or worship?

* **The Good, the True, the Beautiful:** These are sometimes called “transcendentals” – properties of being that point to God. Which of these (goodness, truth, beauty) most moves you personally toward faith in God? For example, are you more convinced by moral experience (a strong sense of justice or love), by intellectual conviction (the logic of a First Cause), or by experiences of beauty and awe? Share an example that affected your faith or worldview.

* **Classical vs. Personal:** Classical theism gives us a grand, philosophical view of God. How do we reconcile this with the more **personal** way we relate to God in prayer and in the Bible? (For instance, the God who is Ipsum Esse – Being itself – is also the God we call “Father” and who became incarnate in Jesus.) Do you feel tension between these concepts, or do you see them as complementary? Discuss how God can be both *utterly beyond* and yet *intimately near*, as Christianity teaches.

* **Trinity and Classical Theism (for those interested):** Hart’s talk was more about the philosophical definition of God common to many faiths. In our Christian context, how does this classical understanding of God’s nature enrich our view of the Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit)? (For example, the Trinity is *one* in being – there’s not three gods, but one infinite Being – and yet personal in three eternal relationships. Does classical theism help articulate that mystery, or raise further questions?)

Feel free to explore other questions or confusions that came up for you as well. The goal is to engage with these ideas honestly and thoughtfully. Everyone comes from different backgrounds – some of this might be brand new and mind-bending, and that’s okay! Let’s learn from each other’s insights and even doubts.

## 5. Biblical Commentary on Key Verses

Finally, let’s ground our discussion in **Scripture**, looking at two key biblical verses that relate to this classical conception of God. We’ll see how the Bible itself contains and supports many of these philosophical insights about God’s nature:

* **Exodus 3:14 – “I AM WHO I AM.”**
  This is one of the most significant verses for understanding who God is. In this scene, Moses asks God for His name, and God replies: *“I AM WHO I AM… Say this to the people of Israel, ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”* (In Hebrew, *YHWH* is related to the verb “to be.”) The Greek translation (Septuagint) renders it as *“I am He Who Is”*, and the Latin Vulgate similarly has *Ego sum qui sum* (“I am who am”). **What does this mean?** It can sound mysterious, but the classical understanding is that God is expressing *self-existence and eternal being*. Church fathers like St. **Gregory of Nazianzus** noted that God chose this name *“as most appropriate, for it bespeaks absolute existence, independent of anything else”*. In other words, only God can say “**I AM**” in an ultimate sense – His existence doesn’t derive from any higher reality. St. **Jerome** explained that when God said “I AM,” He was claiming to be *“the one whose nature alone truly is… all things else, although they appear to be, are not \[truly independent], for they began and may cease. **God alone**, having no beginning, **really deserves to be called ‘Being’ or ‘Essence.’**”*. This is a remarkable insight: even in the time of Moses, God was revealing that His “name” is *Existence Itself*. Thomas Aquinas built on this, saying that **God’s essence is to exist**, which is why no created being shares God’s unique name “He Who Is”. For our faith, Exodus 3:14 tells us that God is not one more being in the universe, but the foundational being **underlying** the universe. It also implies God’s **unchanging, eternal nature** – as Gregory put it, for God there is no “was” or “will be,” only an eternal **NOW** of being. When Jesus later says in John 8:58, *“Before Abraham was, **I AM**,”* He’s echoing this divine name, identifying Himself with the “I AM” of Exodus. In a devotional sense, Exodus 3:14 can be deeply comforting: the One who promised to be with Moses and Israel is *Being itself* – which means He is unconditionally there, the **same yesterday, today, and forever**. Unlike worldly things that come and go, God doesn’t change or fail; He simply IS. Thus, when we rely on God, we’re relying on the most solid reality possible.

* **Acts 17:28 – “In Him we live and move and have our being.”**
  In Acts 17, Apostle Paul is speaking to Greek philosophers in Athens. He tells them about the true God, referencing their own poets who said, *“we are his offspring.”* Paul uses this quote to connect with their intuition that humanity comes from God, and then he adds: *“In Him \[God] we live and move and have our being.”* This is a powerful, succinct biblical affirmation of **God’s immanence** and our dependence on Him. What does it mean? Essentially, Paul is saying that at every moment, our existence and life *depend on God’s sustaining power*. We don’t live *outside* of God’s influence, as if God were far away; rather, we exist **within God’s overarching will and presence**. Early Christian commentators loved this verse because it so clearly supports God as the continual **sustainer** of the world. For instance, **John Calvin** comments: *“We are contained in God by His power… He dwells in us by His Spirit… not that all things are God (Paul isn’t saying stones or people *are* God), but that **God’s power and spirit preserve those things which He created out of nothing**. He is so present that if He were to withdraw, we would not exist for a moment.”*. Calvin also ties this to God’s name *Jehovah* (related to “I AM”), noting that God alone has life in Himself, whereas *“we have our being in Him”*, and *“He upholds us”*. Similarly, the verse implies **God’s omnipresence** – not that God is everything (that would be pantheism, which Paul denies in the context of rejecting idols), but that God is *everywhere present to everything*. The context in Acts 17 is that God “is actually not far from each one of us” (17:27). This challenges us to realize: wherever we are, whatever we’re doing, God is the One giving us breath, allowing our hearts to beat, giving our minds the ability to think. It’s a very intimate picture of God’s relationship to creation. We are *enveloped* by God’s sustaining love and power constantly. If He stopped willing us to exist, we’d simply cease. That might sound scary, but in Scripture it’s meant to inspire trust and the **seeking of God** – because God is so near and life-giving, we should reach out to Him. Paul’s sermon uses this truth to argue against idols: since we live in God, we shouldn’t think God is an idol confined to a temple or statue. Rather, He is an **environment of existence** for us. For personal application, Acts 17:28 can transform how we see our daily life: every moment is lived *coram Deo* (before the face of God). We are never outside of God’s concern or presence. Even those who don’t know God are still being upheld by Him – hence, as long as we have life and breath, we have the opportunity to seek and find our Creator.

In both verses, we see how **biblical revelation and classical theology meet**. Exodus 3:14 gives the *ontological* name of God (I AM Being), and Acts 17:28 gives the *relationship* of creation to God (utter dependence and nearness). Together, they paint a picture of the God classical theism describes: the One who simply IS, who is the source of all that is, and in whom everything holds together.

**Other supporting scriptures:** There are many other Bible passages that harmonise with this view of God. For example, *Psalm 90:2* – “From everlasting to everlasting, You are God” – speaks to God’s eternal self-existence. *Colossians 1:16-17* says of Christ, “all things were created through Him and for Him… and **in Him all things hold together**,” echoing the Acts 17 idea of continual sustenance. *Hebrews 1:3* likewise says the Son “upholds the universe by the word of His power.” In the Old Testament, *Isaiah 40:28* asks, “Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary,” highlighting God’s inexhaustible being and power, in contrast to created things. The Bible consistently directs us to a God who is **eternal, uncreated, life-giving, and incomparable** – exactly the God Hart is urging us to rediscover.

By studying these verses alongside Hart’s insights, we can appreciate that classical theism is not an abstract philosophical add-on to Christianity; it’s deeply **rooted in Scripture’s own portrayal of God**. The God we meet in prayer and worship is the very same “I AM” – the one in whom we exist and who is closer to us than our own souls. This understanding can deepen our awe and trust: God is infinitely above us, the source of all, yet graciously present with us.

*In closing, Session 1’s exploration sets the stage for the rest of our journey. We’ve clarified “what we mean by God” in the classical sense – an all-powerful, all-knowing, all-good Being who is the ground of reality itself. With this foundation, we can move forward in the coming sessions to explore more of what David Bentley Hart and others say about experiencing God (in conscience, in prayer, in Christ, etc.), knowing that we are talking about the **very Source of our being**. Hopefully, this expanded understanding leads us not only to intellectual insight but to a deeper reverence and love for God – the One “in whom we live and move and have our being,” and in whom alone our restless hearts find rest.*&#x20;
