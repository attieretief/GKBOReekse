# Grounding Our Worldview: A Metaphysical Exploration of God

# Program Structure, and session discussion guides

## Introduction

We are launching a discussion series to **explore the foundations of the Christian worldview**—specifically the profound questions about God’s existence, nature, and how we experience Him. In a reformed church that emphasises Scripture (***sola Scriptura***), it’s vital to create a *safe space* where we can ask hard questions and seek understanding together. This program invites us to investigate the *“metaphysics”* behind our faith—those underlying realities and first principles that shape our belief in God. By doing so, we follow a long tradition of Christian thinkers (from Augustine and Aquinas to Calvin and Plantinga) who have sought to love God not only with heart and soul, but also with the **mind** (Mark 12:30).

Why focus on metaphysics? Because **clarifying who God is and how He relates to everything** lays the groundwork for all other discussions in apologetics and theology. Often, debates about God go astray due to misconceptions. Thus, our first task is to understand *what we truly mean by “God.”* The classical Christian understanding of God is unique: *“God” is not one being among many, but the infinite source and ground of all being*. This transcendent-yet-immanent Creator is fundamentally different from the finite “gods” of myth. As the Westminster Catechism puts it, **“God is a Spirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable in His being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth.”** Grasping this exalted vision of God will help us engage modern questions more fairly. Many skeptics today aim their critiques at a straw-man—a caricature of God as an arbitrary sky-dwelling being—missing the true Christian conception. In our sessions, we will gently address these misunderstandings and replace them with insight from Scripture, reason, and revered Christian writers.

In each session, we will delve into a key theme (outlined below) that builds our “metaphysical framework.” The tone will be **philosophical yet accessible**, and always tethered to Scripture. We will wrestle with questions like: *Why is there something rather than nothing? How can a timeless God relate to a changing world? What makes human consciousness special? Why do we instinctively long for meaning and joy beyond this world?* In exploring these, we’ll see how **the Christian answer to each points back to God** as the ultimate truth, goodness, and beauty our hearts seek.

Above all, this series is not about abstract theory for its own sake. It’s about deepening our worship. As John Calvin observed, every person has a *“sense of deity”* inscribed on the heart, a restless yearning for God. By studying the foundations of our faith, we pray that this natural impulse will be awakened into a richer knowledge of God. *“You have made us for Yourself, O Lord, and our heart is restless until it rests in You,”* wrote Augustine. Let this journey help lead our restless hearts to find rest in the God who is nearer to us than we are to ourselves.

**How to use this guide:** Each session outline below includes a brief overview of the topic, key Scripture references (for grounding our discussion in God’s Word), a few open-ended *Discussion Questions*, and recommended readings for those who want to dig deeper. Feel free to bring your own questions and reflections to each session. This is a *discussion*, not a lecture—our goal is to learn from one another as we seek the truth in love (Eph 4:15). Let’s approach each topic with humility, curiosity, and confidence that **all truth is God’s truth**.

## Program Roadmap

Below is an outline of the planned sessions and the core questions or themes we’ll explore in each. *(We may adjust or expand certain topics as needed, but this gives a guiding structure for our journey.)*

1. **What Do We Mean by “God”?** – Clarifying the concept of God in classical Christian thought vs. “gods” or idols. God’s attributes (infinite, eternal, uncaused) and why He is *“Being Itself”* rather than a being in the world.
2. **Common Misconceptions about God** – Tackling modern skepticism and “straw man” portrayals of God. How New Atheist critiques often miss the classical idea of God. Distinguishing the true God from a cosmic “superhero” or distant watchmaker.
3. **Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?** – The question of existence. Understanding contingency: the universe could have not existed, so what sustains it? Discussing the **Cosmological Argument** and the need for a necessary, uncaused cause of everything (pointing to God).
4. **God: Transcendent Creator and Immanent Sustainer** – Exploring God’s *transcendence* (beyond and above creation) and *immanence* (present within creation). How God can be utterly holy and other, yet *“in Him we live and move and have our being”* (Acts 17:28). God as the **ground of being** and the doctrine of divine simplicity (God is not composed or changeable).
5. **The Mystery of Consciousness** – Why mind and consciousness pose a problem for strict materialism. The “hard problem” of subjective experience (qualia) and why our capacity for reason, self-awareness, and moral understanding suggests a reality beyond matter. How being made in God’s image (Gen 1:27) informs our view of the soul.
6. **Reason, Meaning, and Intentionality** – The mind’s *“aboutness”* (intentionality) and search for truth. How our ability to reason and aim at truth points to a rational Source. We’ll discuss arguments by thinkers like C.S. Lewis and Alvin Plantinga that if our minds were solely products of blind evolution, we couldn’t trust them for truth. Instead, our rational faculties make sense if a rational God created us.
7. **Human Longing for the Infinite** – Exploring the universal desire for transcendental things—perfect goodness, beauty, eternal life (what classical thought calls *“bliss” or “beatitude”*). Why **nothing in this world fully satisfies our deepest longings**, which hints that we were made for communion with God. We’ll look at Augustine’s and C.S. Lewis’s insights into this *“argument from desire.”*
8. **Seeking God: The Journey of Experience** – Tying it all together: how knowing about God leads to knowing God personally. The balance of intellectual pursuit and spiritual practice. We’ll reflect on Scriptures that invite us to *“taste and see that the Lord is good”* (Ps 34:8) and *“seek Him with all our hearts”* (Jer 29:13). God is both beyond our understanding and closer than our breath. The ultimate goal is a **transformative encounter** with God – the union of being, consciousness, and joy in Him.

### Our Posture for the Journey

We follow Calvin’s insight that every person has a *sensus divinitatis* — an innate awareness of the Divine — and Augustine’s prayer: *“You have made us for Yourself, O Lord, and our heart is restless until it finds its rest in You.”*

Therefore, we approach this series not as a cold intellectual exercise, but as a road toward **deeper worship**. Our aim is that the Lord will enlighten our minds and set our hearts ablaze.

Bring your Bible. Bring your questions. Bring your whole heart. And let us walk this road in humility, curiosity, and the certainty that all truth is God’s truth.

## Session 1: **What Do We Mean by “God”?** (The Concept of God vs. ‘gods’)

### **Overview:** 

We begin by defining our terms. In everyday language, people use “God” in many different ways. Our aim is to recover the **classical Christian concept of God** as understood by the great monotheistic faiths and the historic church. Unlike the pagan *“gods”* (finite beings within the universe), the capital-G **God is the one infinite Source of all that exists**. He is *eternal (without beginning), uncreated, omnipotent, omnipresent,* and the *ground of all being*. In other words, God is not just one very powerful being among others but *Being Itself* – the fullness of existence on which all else depends. This session will unpack what it means for God to be *transcendent* (utterly beyond the world) and yet *immanent* (intimately sustaining the world).

We will contrast God with the concept of lesser “gods” or idols. Scripture often highlights this contrast: *“Great is the Lord, and most worthy of praise; He is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but the Lord made the heavens.”* (Psalm 96:4–5). Unlike man-made gods, the true God alone is the Creator of everything from nothing (Genesis 1:1, Acts 17:24). He says **“I AM WHO I AM”** (Exodus 3:14), revealing Himself as the One whose essence *is* existence – the self-sufficient One. We will discuss why it matters that God is *simple* (not composed of parts), *immutable* (unchanging), and *infinite*. These attributes safeguard the important idea that God **does not depend on anything outside Himself**.

We’ll also touch on the intuitive knowledge of God that humans have. According to Calvin, *“there exists in the human mind by natural instinct a sense of Deity”* — an innate awareness of God’s existence and majesty. This means that even before analyzing arguments, people have a basic understanding that there is a higher power. Our very capacity to discuss and yearn for God points to His reality. Even when cultures worship various gods, that **universal religious impulse** is a sign that our hearts know there is Something (or Someone) beyond the material world. In Romans 1:19–20, Paul similarly teaches that knowledge of God’s eternal power and divine nature is “plain” from creation. In sum, we will clarify *who* the God is that we as Christians are talking about, to set the stage for everything that follows.

### **Key Scripture:** 

Genesis 1:1; Exodus 3:14; Deuteronomy 6:4; Acts 17:24–28; Psalm 96:4–5; Romans 1:19–20. *(These passages affirm God as the sole Creator, self-existent and sustaining all things, unlike false gods.)*

### **Discussion Questions:**

* When you hear the word “God,” what ideas or images come to mind? How do these compare to the Bible’s description of God?
* How is the **God of the Bible unique** compared to the gods of ancient mythologies or popular culture’s “superheroes”? Why is it important to recognize God’s category as wholly different (the Creator, not part of creation)?
* What does it mean that God is *“the ground of being”* or even *“Being itself”*? How might Acts 17:28 (“in Him we live and move and have our being”) illustrate God’s transcendence and immanence?
* Calvin asserted that all people have an innate sense of God. Do you agree that belief in God is humanity’s “default setting”? Why or why not? How do you see this innate desire for God manifest in society or in your own experience?

### **Recommended Reading:**

* **John Calvin – *Institutes of the Christian Religion*, Book I, ch. 3:** *“The Knowledge of God Naturally Implanted in the Human Mind.”* (Calvin argues that an awareness of God is universal and inborn.)
* **Westminster Shorter Catechism Q\&A 4:** *“What is God?”* (A concise summary of God’s attributes as infinite Spirit.)
* **A.W. Tozer – *The Knowledge of the Holy*, ch. 1-2:** An accessible devotional philosophy on God’s attributes and why understanding God rightly matters for worship.
* **David Bentley Hart – *The Experience of God*** (Introduction) – *optional:* Although we aren’t directly following Hart’s book in this course, the introduction offers a careful definition of God across major religions, emphasizing the classical attributes.

## Session 2: **Dispelling Myths: Modern Misconceptions of God**

### **Overview:** 

Building on our definition of God, we now address some **common misunderstandings** that arise in modern atheist or skeptical critiques. A number of popular-level books and memes today ridicule belief in God by likening Him to an “invisible sky fairy” or a capricious bearded man in the clouds. We need to recognize these as *straw man* portrayals that don’t engage with what serious Christian theology actually claims. Often, skeptics target a *demiurge* (a powerful being within the universe) rather than the true transcendent Creator. This session will enumerate a few of these caricatures and patiently correct them:

* **“God is just an ancient superstition or a psychological crutch.”** We’ll discuss how such claims ignore the robust philosophical arguments and experiences that have led thinkers to affirm God’s reality. Christian belief is not about plugging gaps in knowledge with magic, but about a coherent explanation for why anything (including reason itself) exists.
* **“Believers think God is a big man upstairs who occasionally intervenes (a ‘god of the gaps’).”** In truth, classical Christianity sees God as *continuously sustaining* every aspect of reality, not merely a handyman who inserts miracles here or there. He’s not an item within the universe, so looking for God with a telescope misses the point.
* **“If God created the universe, who created God?”** This question misunderstands what Christians mean by God. God by definition is the uncreated First Cause – the *necessary being* that explains why contingent things exist. Asking who made the unmade Maker is a category mistake. (We’ll refer to arguments from Thomas Aquinas or Leibniz, which show that an infinite regress of causes doesn’t solve the riddle of existence – only something outside the chain, *“a being whose essence is existence,”* suffices.)
* **Misreading Biblical Descriptions:** Critics often quote Old Testament passages about God’s anger or portrayals of God walking in the garden, then claim believers think God is a temperamental old man. We’ll explain literary anthropomorphisms (God described in human terms) and how Christian theology interprets them in light of God’s true infinite nature and holiness.

Throughout, we aim to replace ridicule with understanding. As one commentator noted, **skeptics should contend with what theism *really* proposes, not a “patently silly straw man”**. This session invites honest questions the group might have heard or struggled with. By the end, we should see that much of modern atheism “often misunderstands the classical concept of God” (to quote Hart’s observation) and thus ends up *“going easy on themselves”* by defeating only a trivial idea. We want to encourage intellectual fairness: just as a critic should know real physics before dismissing it, one should know what Christians truly mean by “God” before rejecting Him.

Importantly, we will also reflect on **our own misconceptions**. Even devout believers can fall into thinking of God too narrowly (as merely a problem-solver or as distant and uninvolved). Scripture corrects us: God is *both* the Almighty King beyond space and time **and** the loving Father who knows every hair on our heads. Maintaining this balance helps prevent doubt and confusion.

### **Key Scripture:** 

Isaiah 55:8–9 (God’s ways and thoughts higher than ours); Acts 17:29 (God is not an idol made by human design); 1 Kings 8:27 (*“Heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain You”*); Psalm 50:21 (rebuking the idea that God is altogether like us). Also, verses like John 4:24 (*“God is spirit”*) and Numbers 23:19 (God is not a man) reinforce that God cannot be reduced to a humanlike being.

### **Discussion Questions:**

* What are some depictions or arguments about God you’ve encountered from skeptics or in popular culture? Did they accurately represent the God you know from Scripture?
* Why do you think caricatures of God (as an angry tyrant, or a mythical being) persist? How can we gently correct these among our friends or in our own thinking?
* How would you respond to the question “Who made God?” or the claim “Belief in God is like believing in the Tooth Fairy”?
* In what ways might *we* as Christians sometimes bring God down to a too-human level in our imagination (for example, doubting His care, thinking of Him as “on our side” against others, etc.)? How does maintaining a proper, exalted view of God’s nature help our faith?

### **Recommended Reading:**

* **Alvin Plantinga – “The Dawkins Confusion” (article)** – A sharp but readable review of Richard Dawkins’ *The God Delusion*. Plantinga highlights logical flaws in Dawkins’ critique of God (showing how Dawkins assumes a very crude notion of God and complexity).
* **C.S. Lewis – *Mere Christianity*, Book II Chapter 1 (“The Rival Conceptions of God”):** Lewis distinguishes between inadequate ideas of God and the Christian view. This can help in explaining why not all “gods” are equal and why Christianity isn’t the same as believing in Santa Claus.
* **Edward Feser – *Five Proofs of the Existence of God*, Introduction:** Feser (a philosopher) briefly addresses common objections and emphasizes understanding what the term “God” signifies in classical philosophy, to avoid talking past each other.
* **R.C. Sproul – *The Character of God*** (video or booklet) – Sproul, from a Reformed perspective, discusses God’s attributes in a pastoral way, often tackling misunderstandings like “God is just a bigger version of us.”

## Session 3: **“Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?” – The Question of Existence**

### **Overview:** 

Now we turn to one of the most fundamental metaphysical questions: *Why does anything exist at all?* The very existence of the universe (and ourselves within it) cannot be taken for granted. This session explores the **contingency of creation** and the classic reasoning that the existence of a contingent universe points to a necessary, self-existent God.

We’ll introduce the concept of **contingency**: something is “contingent” if it does not have to exist; it depends on something else and could have been otherwise. The universe, with all its galaxies, laws, and matter, appears contingent – it didn’t *have* to be, and it changes. Scientific cosmology points to a beginning (the Big Bang), but even if one imagines an eternal universe, the question remains: *Why is there an eternal something and not nothing?* The **principle of sufficient reason**, articulated by Gottfried Leibniz, says that everything that exists has a reason or cause sufficient to explain it. According to Leibniz, *“the first question which we have a right to ask will be, ‘Why is there something rather than nothing?’… The sufficient reason… must be outside of the series of contingent things… found in a necessary being… This ultimate reason for things is called God.”*. In simpler terms, no matter how far back or deep you go into natural explanations, *at some point the chain of contingency needs a source that exists by its own power*.

We will discuss **cosmological arguments** in an accessible way. One form (Aquinas’ and later William Lane Craig’s Kalam argument) focuses on the universe having a beginning that needs a cause. Another form (Leibniz’s argument from contingency) doesn’t require a time-beginning, but says even an eternal universe would require a sustaining reason beyond itself. Both converge on the idea of a necessary, uncaused cause. We will clarify that calling God the “First Cause” does not mean God is just the *earliest* cause in time, but rather the fundamental cause at *all moments*, keeping everything in existence. Acts 17:28 reminds us: *“In Him we live and move and have our being.”* Similarly, Hebrews 1:3 says the Son of God *“upholds the universe by the word of His power.”* This continuous dependence of creation on the Creator is key.

It’s also important to note **what the cosmological argument doesn’t claim**: it’s not a scientific description of *how* the universe began (that’s for cosmologists to explore), but a philosophical inference about *why there is a universe at all*. We’ll discuss why naturalism (the view that nature is all there is) struggles here. If someone says, “The universe just exists as a brute fact,” we can point out that this answer leaves us with a logical tension: everything within the universe has causes/reasons, yet the entire set is asserted to have none – an arguably unsatisfying position that some call *“just magical thinking”*. By contrast, positing God as the necessary being isn’t a cop-out; it’s identifying the only kind of reality that *could* explain why there is something (an eternal, self-existent mind). We will ensure everyone understands that God, in Christian understanding, is uncaused not arbitrarily, but because *His essence is to exist* – He is the *“I AM”* (Ex. 3:14) and thus the ground for all other existence.

We can illustrate with analogies: for instance, a train with infinitely many boxcars still needs an engine; or a book copied from eternity (as per Leibniz’s thought experiment) still needs an author for the content. The takeaway: **the universe’s existence points beyond itself**. The logical alternative to God would be true nothingness – but we plainly are not nothing! Therefore, this session reinforces that **belief in God is a rational response to the mystery of existence**, and that naturalism fails to provide an ultimate answer to “Why is there anything at all?”.

### **Key Scripture:** 

Acts 17:24–28 (Paul proclaims God as creator of the world, who gives life and breath to all, and in whom we exist); Colossians 1:16–17 (all things created *through* Christ and *for* Him, and “in Him all things hold together”); Hebrews 11:3 (the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of visible things); Psalm 90:2 (God is from everlasting to everlasting, **God has no origin**).

### **Discussion Questions:**

* Have you ever pondered why there is a universe (and we exist) instead of nothing? What feelings or thoughts does that provoke?
* How would you explain to a friend the idea that the universe needs a cause or reason beyond itself? Can an infinite series of physical causes explain existence, or do we still need an *ultimate* cause?
* Some people say, “The universe just exists without explanation.” Do you find that answer satisfying? Why or why not?
* If God is the answer to “who made the universe,” one might ask “then who made God?” – How is God different from the universe in this regard? (Hint: consider the difference between something that *begins* or *could not be*, and One who is eternal and *must be*.)
* How do biblical statements about God’s self-existence (Exodus 3:14, Psalm 90:2) and role as sustainer (Acts 17:28) deepen our understanding of these philosophical arguments?

### **Recommended Reading:**

* **G.W. Leibniz – “On the Ultimate Origin of Things” (1697):** In this short essay, Leibniz famously asks why anything exists and concludes it must be due to God, *“a necessary being… which carries the reason of its existence within itself.”* Excerpts can be found in philosophy anthologies.
* **Edward Feser – *Five Proofs of the Existence of God*, Chapter on the “Aristotelian proof”:** A modern explanation of Aquinas’ unmoved mover argument (closely related to contingency) in accessible language.
* **William Lane Craig – *Reasonable Faith*, Chapter 3 (Cosmological Argument):** Craig lays out the Kalam cosmological argument (focused on the beginning of the universe) and addresses common objections. This reading also touches on scientific evidence for the universe’s beginning.
* **John Piper – “The Great I AM” (Sermon on Exodus 3:14):** A pastoral reflection highlighting God’s self-existence and what it means for us that God simply *is*. Helps connect the philosophical concept to devotion.

## Session 4: **God as the Reality Behind All Realities (Transcendence and Immanence)**

### **Overview:** 

In this session we delve deeper into the **nature of God’s existence** in relation to the world. We’ve established God as the necessary being and creator; now we consider *how* God exists *in* everything without being limited *by* anything. This brings us to the twin truths of **transcendence** and **immanence**. Holding these together gives us a balanced, awe-inspiring view of God.

* **God’s Transcendence:** God is *wholly “other.”* He is high above the created order in glory, power, and being. *“For I am God and not man, the Holy One in your midst”* (Hosea 11:9). Solomon exclaimed, *“Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain You”* (1 Kings 8:27). Transcendence means God is not constrained by space or time; He created them. He’s **eternal**, **immutable** (Malachi 3:6), and His being is of a fundamentally different order than ours (as we saw, *ipsum esse* – the act of being itself). We will discuss the idea from classical theology that God has no *potential* in Him – He is *pure act* (actus purus), meaning He isn’t gradually changing or improving. All perfections of being are fully in Him from eternity. This underscores why God is unlike any contingent being. When Scripture says *“God is Light”* or *“God is Love,”* it conveys that He doesn’t merely *have* these qualities, He *is* them in their perfect source.
* **God’s Immanence:** Amazingly, this utterly transcendent God is also intimately present in every part of creation. Immanence means **God indwells and sustains the world** at every moment. Acts 17:27-28 affirms that God is *“not far from each one of us”*. He’s closer to us than the air we breathe – in fact, as St. Augustine phrased it, God is *“more inward to me than my inmost self”*. We’ll explore how God’s immanence doesn’t reduce Him to a world-force (He’s not *identified* with nature, as in pantheism) but rather He is present to every creature while still exceeding all. Psalm 139 beautifully describes that there is nowhere in the universe one can flee from God’s presence. Every heartbeat, every atom’s motion, testifies to God’s sustaining hand.

Reflecting on these truths can be mind-bending. How can God be 100% present here with us, and simultaneously beyond the galaxies? The key is that God is spirit (John 4:24) and infinite. Unlike physical beings, God’s being is not spread thin or divided. He can be fully with you and fully with me. Theologians use **analogy** to speak of this: e.g., *“the sun is above and beyond the earth (transcendent), yet its light and heat pervade the earth (immanent).”* Even that falls short, but it gives a glimpse.

We also introduce the notion of **Divine Simplicity** in simpler terms: God is not made of parts or properties; He is *one* perfect reality. Therefore, His attributes (love, justice, power, knowledge) are all perfectly unified in Him. This means when God is present to us, all of God is present (He doesn’t just *partially* show up). It also means God’s transcendence *ensures* His immanence – because He is not a thing among things, nothing can exclude Him from anywhere. As Jeremiah 23:24 records God’s words, *“Do I not fill heaven and earth?”*

We will discuss practical implications: A God who is both transcendent and immanent is both **worthy of worshipful fear and deeply comforting**. Transcendence gives us reverence (we can’t control or fully comprehend Him; He is King). Immanence gives us confidence (He is *Emmanuel, God with us*, sustaining and caring at every moment). The incarnation of Christ wonderfully manifests both: the infinite Word became flesh and dwelt among us (John 1:14) – God’s immanent presence in a new, redemptive way without ceasing to be the transcendent God.

### **Key Scripture:** 

Isaiah 57:15 (“The High and Lofty One… who also dwells with the contrite” – one verse showing both transcendence and immanence); Jeremiah 23:23–24 (God fills heaven and earth, nothing is hidden); Psalm 139:7–10 (God’s inescapable presence); 1 Kings 8:27 (God transcends the temple and heavens); John 1:14 and Colossians 2:9 (in Christ, *“all the fullness of Deity”* dwells bodily – a tangible expression of God’s presence).

### **Discussion Questions:**

* In your own words, what’s the difference between saying “God is a supreme being in the universe” versus “God is *Being* itself, the source of the universe”? Which view did you grow up with, and has it shifted?
* How do you react emotionally to God’s transcendence? What about His immanence? (For example: Does knowing God is infinitely above you comfort you or intimidate you? Does knowing He is present everywhere feel comforting or invasive?)
* Can you think of instances in Scripture or personal life where God’s nearness was evident? How about moments emphasizing His majesty and otherness?
* The doctrine of divine simplicity (God isn’t made of parts) is abstract; why might it matter for our faith? (One possible answer: if God were composed of parts or qualities, something would have to hold those parts together, implying something more fundamental than God – which can’t be. Simplicity safeguards that God alone is the Absolute.)
* How does Jesus bridge God’s transcendence and immanence for us?

### **Recommended Reading:**

* **Stephen Charnock – *The Existence and Attributes of God*** (Selections on God’s infinitude and omnipresence). Charnock, a Puritan, eloquently writes about God being everywhere wholly present and what that means for believers.
* **Herman Bavinck – *Reformed Dogmatics*, Vol. 2 (God and Creation), “God’s Incomprehensibility” and “Omnipresence”:** Bavinck provides a solid Reformed perspective on transcendence/immanence and why both are essential.
* **A.W. Tozer – *The Pursuit of God*, Chapter 14 “The Universal Presence”:** A devotional take on practicing awareness of God’s presence. Short and heart-orientated.
* **Credo Magazine article: “Not a Cistern, but a Fountain” by J. V. Fesko** – Explains classical Christian metaphysics in an approachable way, including the idea that God is not a being among beings, but the very source of all being (with Reformed theologians’ insights confirming this).

## Session 5: **The Enigma of Mind and Consciousness**

### **Overview:** 

Human **consciousness** – our ability to experience, think, and say “I” – is one of the greatest mysteries in both philosophy and science. In this session, we examine why consciousness points to something beyond mere matter. We’ll consider how this connects to our belief in God, the *“ground of consciousness.”*

First, what do we mean by consciousness? It includes qualities like subjective experience (there is “something it is like” to see the color red or taste honey), self-awareness, intentionality (thoughts *about* things), rationality, and moral awareness. The materialist view says ultimately these are products of physical brain activity alone. However, many thinkers (including non-theists) have noted **serious problems with a purely material explanation of mind**. We will explore a few:

* **The Hard Problem of Consciousness:** Why do we have first-person subjective experiences (qualia) at all? For instance, all the brain science in the world can map what wavelengths of light do in your brain, but it can’t reach the *experience* of seeing red – the redness itself. Consciousness is a reality that doesn’t neatly reduce to physical description. As philosopher Thomas Nagel famously said, *“Consciousness is the most conspicuous obstacle to a comprehensive naturalism that relies only on physical science.”* It stubbornly resists explanation in terms of just neurons firing. Materialist theories can tell us *when* brain states correlate with feeling pain, but not *why* a certain neural pattern should produce the *sensation* of pain in the first place.
* **The Reality of Mind vs. Illusions:** Some ultra-materialists claim consciousness is an illusion. But that is self-defeating – an illusion is *itself* a conscious experience! We’ll have a bit of fun with this: if someone says, “Your feeling of self is just an illusion created by neurons,” one might ask *“Who* is being deceived by this illusion if not your conscious self?”\* The very fact we can have this discussion shows consciousness is undeniably real.
* **Intentionality (Aboutness):** Our thoughts point beyond themselves (e.g. I can think *about* my house or dream *of* a unicorn). But no purely physical thing has this property – a rock or even a brain neuron isn’t “about” something; it just is. One thought leads to another by logical relations, not just physical ones. Physical processes alone don’t account for meaning or reference. This is linked to our capacity for reason: our logical insight seems to be of a different order than electrochemical reactions. As one source put it, *“thoughts have properties – they’re non-spatial, private, and are *about* something – that matter doesn’t have”*. Therefore, mind cannot be simply the same as matter.
* **Free Will and Rationality:** If our mental decisions are nothing but predetermined biochemical reactions, can we truly be said to reason or choose freely? Alvin Plantinga and C.S. Lewis both argued that if naturalism were true, it undercuts our trust in reasoning. Plantinga’s *Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism* suggests that unguided evolution would select for survival behavior, not necessarily true beliefs, making reliable reasoning under pure naturalism questionable. In contrast, if a rational God created our minds, it makes sense that our cognitive faculties can grasp truth (because they reflect, however imperfectly, the divine Logos).

All these points build a cumulative case: **mind is “above nature” in a way that hints at the supernatural**. We will discuss the theistic view: consciousness is not an accident but a gift from the conscious Creator. Our minds reflect (though in a limited way) the mind of God. Genesis 1:27 says we are made in God’s image—this is often connected to our rational, moral, and spiritual capacities. Far from being an embarrassing anomaly, consciousness fits a Christian worldview, which holds that *ultimate reality is not blind matter but a living, knowing Spirit.* In fact, John’s Gospel opens with *“In the beginning was the Word (Logos)”*, implying that divine reason and consciousness undergird the universe.

We should also handle this humbly—many details about *how* mind and body interact remain mysterious. Christians differ on whether the soul is an immaterial substance or an emergent aspect given by God. But all agree that **mind is more than matter** and that human personhood can’t be fully explained by neurons alone. We’ll consider testimonies or thought experiments (like the famous “what is it like to be a bat?” or the scenario of Mary the color scientist who’s never seen color – when she does, she learns something new beyond physical info). These show the limits of a purely physical account.

Ultimately, we see consciousness as a clue: our ability to reason, to know truth, to appreciate goodness and beauty—these are *signals* of the God who is Truth, Goodness, and Beauty Himself. It aligns with what Scripture says in Proverbs 20:27, *“The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord”*, suggesting our consciousness is a candle lit by God to search for meaning.

### **Key Scripture:** 

Genesis 1:27 (humans created in God’s image); Proverbs 20:27 (the human spirit as God’s lamp); John 1:4–5,9 (the Divine Word as the light of men coming into the world); 1 Corinthians 2:11 (“Who knows a person’s thoughts except the spirit of that person?… so no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God” – analogy of human and divine consciousness). Romans 12:2 (the renewal of the mind) could also spark discussion on how our mind relates to God.

### **Discussion Questions:**

* Have you ever thought about what consciousness *is*? How would you describe the experience of being *you*? Can science alone capture that description?
* Do you find the existence of the soul or an immaterial aspect of mind convincing? Why or why not?
* How do our rationality and ability to choose point to something beyond mere physical processes? Can you give an example where you sense the mind’s independence (like resisting a strong physical desire by rational choice)?
* Materialists sometimes say eventually neuroscience will explain all aspects of consciousness. What do you think? Are there aspects of your inner life that you believe will never be on a brain scan?
* In what way does believing “we are made in the image of a rational God” encourage you in your intellectual and creative life?

### **Recommended Reading:**

* **J.P. Moreland – *“Consciousness and the Existence of God”*** (Philosophia Christi, 2008) – An article (or his book of the same title) arguing that consciousness is best explained by the existence of God. Moreland, a Christian philosopher, lays out the argument in a relatively approachable way.
* **Thomas Nagel – *Mind and Cosmos*** (Introduction and Chapter 1) – Nagel is an atheist philosopher who candidly explains why the mind is a problem for materialism. He even says evolutionary naturalism is “almost certainly false” because it can’t account for consciousness. It’s useful to see a non-theist recognize this gap.
* **C.S. Lewis – *Miracles*, Chapter 3-4:** Here Lewis presents his argument from reason. He explains why if the world were nothing but atoms, we’d have no basis to trust our reasoning, thus pointing to something beyond nature that grounds reason.
* **Alvin Plantinga – “Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism”** (short summaries available online) – Plantinga’s argument can be technical, but many summaries exist. It reinforces the point that blind evolution + matter alone doesn’t guarantee true beliefs, thereby indirectly supporting that our reasoning faculty came from a rational Source.

## Session 6: **The Human Quest for Meaning – Intentionality, Morality, and Purpose**

### **Overview:** 

Continuing from consciousness, this session focuses on specific features of the human mind and heart: **intentionality** (the “aboutness” of our thoughts and desires), our search for meaning and purpose, and our moral reasoning. Each of these facets of human experience suggests that we are oriented toward something beyond the material world. We ask: *Why do we incessantly ask “why”? Why do we feel certain things *ought* to be a certain way?* The Christian worldview answers: because we are made by and for God, imbued with a purpose that reflects His mind and character.

**Intentionality & Truth-Seeking:** As touched on, intentionality is the mind’s ability to be “about” something – our thoughts can refer to objects, abstract ideas, even imaginary entities. This is remarkable. Physical processes have causes and effects, but they aren’t **about** anything. A neuron firing in the brain isn’t “about” a tree, but *your thought* can be about a tree. This directedness of the mind points to a transcendent origin. It’s as if our minds are arrows aiming at understanding reality. Why should lumps of matter care about truth? Yet we find within us a relentless curiosity and drive to know *meaning*. Acts 17:27 says God arranged the world in such a way that humans *“would seek Him, in the hope that they might feel their way toward Him and find Him.”* Our intentionality ultimately finds its target in God – the *ultimate* Truth and Meaning. As Augustine prayed, “*O Lord, everywhere you goad us to find joy in praising you, because you have made us for yourself…”* (Confessions). We sense this goading in our hunger to figure out life’s purpose.

**Moral Realism:** Most people have a sense that some things are objectively right or wrong (justice is good, torturing children is evil, etc.). If the universe were purely material and accidental, it’s hard to account for any binding moral truths – it would all be human preference or genetic conditioning. But our conviction that certain values are real (not just opinions) aligns with the existence of a moral God. Philosopher Alvin Plantinga quipped that *objective moral obligation makes no sense in a purely naturalistic universe – to whom or what are we obligated, the impersonal laws of physics?* Yet if God is real, moral laws are expressions of His nature (His goodness and justice), and our conscience is His witness within us (Romans 2:14-15 speaks of the law written on our hearts). We will discuss how our *sense of duty, guilt, and virtue* suggest a moral order to the cosmos – one grounded in God. As Kant famously said, two things filled him with awe: “the starry heavens above and the moral law within.” Both point beyond themselves.

**Purpose and Teleology:** Humans ask not just “How does this work?” but “Why am I here? What is it for?” This sense of **teleology** (purpose or goal-directedness) pervades our thinking. Even in nature, we often see systems working towards an end (eyes are for seeing, ecosystems maintain balance, etc.). While biology can explain proximate causes, the pervasive *appearance of design and purpose* in life has long been seen as a clue to a Designer. More personally, our lives feel meaningful when aligned with a purpose; conversely, loss of purpose is crippling. The Christian claim is that God created us *with* intention – to know and love Him, to steward creation, to love others. Ephesians 2:10: *“For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand.”* If God doesn’t exist, any sense of higher purpose is ultimately illusory – the universe doesn’t “care.” But we *can’t live* as if purpose isn’t real. In fact, even secular folks often devote themselves to causes bigger than themselves. Christianity says that impulse is fulfilled when we connect with God’s ultimate purpose.

In sum, the **mind’s directedness, the conscience’s demands, and the heart’s search for meaning** all point to God as their proper end. This session will likely be more discussion-oriented, as these topics engage our personal moral intuitions and life experiences. We’ll be careful to acknowledge the reality of moral struggle and existential angst – these, too, the Bible addresses in the narrative of fall and redemption. Our incompleteness finds completion in relationship with our Creator.

### **Key Scripture:** 

Romans 2:14–15 (conscience and moral law in the heart); Ecclesiastes 3:11 (“He has put eternity in the human heart” – a desire for ultimate meaning); Micah 6:8 (God’s moral expectation: to do justly, love mercy, walk humbly with God, implying a moral framework from God); Matthew 5:6 (“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness…” – a promise that our deep moral yearnings will be fulfilled in God’s kingdom). Also, Proverbs 16:4 (“The Lord has made everything for its purpose…”).

### **Discussion Questions:**

* Do you believe there are universal moral truths? If so, where might they come from? If someone rejects God, on what could they base an objective right and wrong?
* Share a time when you felt a strong sense of purpose or calling. What gave that situation meaning? Conversely, have you experienced a feeling of meaninglessness? How did you deal with it?
* How do you understand the concept that our hearts are “restless until they rest in God” (Augustine)? What kinds of things have you tried to fill your life with meaning, and with what success?
* Can an atheist or naturalist have a moral code and a sense of purpose? (Certainly they can, but we’re asking about the *basis* of it.) Discuss whether the existence of these values is *consistent* with a worldview of pure chance, or better explained by a Creator.
* In what ways does knowing God give intentional shape to your daily decisions (work, relationships, ethics)? How might our belief that humans are created for a reason affect how we treat others?

### **Recommended Reading:**

* **C.S. Lewis – *Mere Christianity*, Book I (“Right and Wrong as a Clue to the Meaning of the Universe”):** Lewis starts his apologetic by arguing that the reality of a Moral Law points to a Moral Lawgiver. A classic, reader-friendly treatment of the moral argument.
* **Alvin Plantinga – *“Naturalism, Theism, and Moral Obligation”*** (online essay) – Plantinga examines whether duty and moral responsibility make sense if nature is all there is. He contends they make much more sense if God exists.
* **Viktor Frankl – *Man’s Search for Meaning***: Though not a theology book (Frankl was a psychotherapist and Holocaust survivor), this work powerfully explores humanity’s need for purpose. It indirectly supports the idea that we are “meaning-seeking” creatures in a way that points to something beyond mere survival.
* **Tim Keller – *Making Sense of God*, Chapter 6: “Morality”** – Keller addresses modern people who desire human rights and justice but don’t believe in God, showing the tension and inviting reconsideration of a divine foundation for moral values.

## Session 7: **“You Have Made Us for Yourself” – The Longing for God (Beatitude or Bliss)**

### **Overview:** 

Here we confront a beautiful truth at the heart of human nature: we are creatures of infinite longing. No matter how much we achieve or acquire, there remains a **deep hunger for something more** – a complete, unending happiness that nothing on earth can fully provide. The Christian tradition calls this ultimate happiness *beatitude* or *bliss*, found only in union with God. In this session, we examine this *“argument from desire.”*

We start with our experiences of longing. It might be an aesthetic experience (music, nature’s beauty) that gives us a fleeting sense of transcendence, or a frustration that even the best moments in life pass and leave us wanting. C.S. Lewis described this as **“joy”** – not just pleasure, but an intense yearning for an unattainable fulfillment, which he took as a pointer to the divine. *“If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy,”* wrote Lewis, *“the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.”*. We will discuss this famous quote and whether the presence of unsatisfiable desires in us suggests we are meant for God. Analogously, hunger implies food, thirst implies water – what does *spiritual thirst* imply? Jesus said, *“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied”* (Matt 5:6), and *“If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink”* (John 7:37).

This ties into the classical idea of **transcendentals** – truth, goodness, and beauty. We have an insatiable appetite for absolute truth (to know ultimately), absolute goodness (perfect love and justice), and absolute beauty (a joy that won’t fade). In Christianity, these converging desires point to God, who is Truth itself, the Good itself, and Beauty itself. *“God is not only the ultimate reality that intellect and will seek, but also the primordial reality we are always engaged with, apart from which we have no experience of anything”* (paraphrasing a modern theologian). In other words, every taste of truth, goodness, or beauty here *participates* in God’s light – giving us hints and echoes of Him.

We will look at Augustine’s testimony: after a youth spent pursuing worldly pleasures and wisdom in various philosophies, he found lasting peace in God. His line *“You have made us for Yourself, and our heart is restless until it rests in You”* succinctly captures Christian experience. Likewise, Pascal observed that humans try to fill their inner void with everything (wealth, power, diversion) but nothing suffices *“since this infinite abyss can be filled only with an infinite and immutable object – God Himself.”*.

We must address: how do we pursue this fulfillment? Christianity doesn’t promise that all desires are met in this life; rather, they point us forward. The ultimate fulfillment is *eschatological* (in the coming Kingdom). However, we get a foretaste now through the Holy Spirit – called the “down payment” of our inheritance (Eph 1:13-14). Psalm 16:11 says *“in Your presence there is fullness of joy; at Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.”* We find significant (though not complete) satisfaction in knowing God here and now – think of the peace beyond understanding (Phil 4:7) or the joy unspeakable (1 Pet 1:8) that believers testify to.

We will encourage each other to see our deep desires not as curses but as clues. Instead of letting the world’s disappointments lead us to despair, we can let them redirect us to God. Every time we experience *“This wasn’t enough”* (even in good things like family, career, etc.), it’s an invitation to remember we’re made for **more** – ultimately, for fellowship with our Creator. As Lewis put it, creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists (infants feel hunger, food exists; we feel sexual desire, sex exists). If we find a desire nothing in time and space can satisfy, perhaps we were made for eternity.

Finally, we’ll consider worship as the expression of this longing. Augustine described worship as the heart’s rest in God through love. When we worship (whether in song, prayer, service), we are in a sense practicing our fulfillment – enjoying God’s presence, even if in a glass darkly. This is why the Westminster Catechism begins, *“Man’s chief end is to glorify God and **enjoy** Him forever.”* Our ultimate bliss is enjoying God. And unlike all finite joys, this one increases the more we partake in it, forever.

### **Key Scripture:** 

Psalm 42:1–2 (soul thirsting for God like a deer for water); Psalm 16:11 (fullness of joy in God’s presence); Philippians 3:8–14 (Paul counting all as loss compared to knowing Christ, pressing on toward the prize – an expression of godly yearning); Revelation 21:6 and 22:17 (God’s promise to give the thirsty the water of life without price). Also, Romans 8:22–23 speaks of all creation groaning in longing, and believers groaning inwardly for our redemption – showing even nature awaits fulfillment in God.

### **Discussion Questions:**

* Can you identify a moment or season in life when you achieved something you thought would make you perfectly happy, yet still felt a “restlessness” or longing afterwards? What did you learn from that?
* What are the deep longings of your heart that nothing in this world seems to satisfy? (E.g., perfect justice, never-ending love, permanent belonging, etc.) How do you interpret those in light of your faith?
* Skeptics might say, “Humans just evolved to always want more; it’s a survival drive.” How would you respond to the idea that our endless longing is more than just evolutionary baggage – that it’s intentional, pointing us to God?
* How do practices like worship, prayer, and Communion satisfy our spiritual hunger even now? Have you experienced a sense of God’s presence that fulfilled you in a way nothing else does?
* Augustine and Pascal spoke of the heart’s emptiness without God. Do you find this language helpful in relating to non-believers (to connect the gospel to their felt needs)? Why or why not?

### **Recommended Reading:**

* **Saint Augustine – *Confessions*, Book I, Chapter 1:** Augustine’s opening paragraphs, where he poetically describes our God-shaped longing, are worth meditating on. (Multiple translations available; also consider Book X where he analyzes various objects of love he tried before finding peace in God.)
* **Blaise Pascal – *Pensées* (Thoughts),** particularly fragments \[425/428] (on the “infinite abyss” that only God fills) and \[148] (on diversion – how people distract themselves to avoid facing the emptiness). Pascal’s notes are fragmentary but piercing on this topic.
* **C.S. Lewis – *The Weight of Glory* (essay):** In this sermon, Lewis speaks of our desires as pointers to heaven. He famously says our desires are not too strong but too weak – we fool around with lesser pleasures when infinite joy is offered. Inspiring and relevant.
* **Peter Kreeft – *“The Argument from Desire”*** (short article or section in *Handbook of Christian Apologetics*): Kreeft, a philosopher, lays out a step-by-step version of the argument that unfulfilled earthly desires imply the existence of God and heaven. Helpful for a systematic understanding.

## Session 8: **Journey’s End and Journey’s Beginning – Seeking and Experiencing God**

### **Overview:** 

In our final session of this series, we reflect on the overarching *journey* we’re on – both intellectually and spiritually. We synthesize how the previous topics (God’s nature, existence, mind, meaning, longing) converge in the actual **experience of God** in a believer’s life. The paradox we hold is that God is *infinitely beyond* what we can comprehend, yet He invites us to *know Him personally*. Our exploration doesn’t end in mere ideas; it’s meant to propel us into a deeper relationship with God.

We will use Augustine’s famous line (which Hart quoted) as a springboard: *God is “higher than my highest and more inward than my innermost self.”* This captures transcendence and immanence again, but in experiential terms. The journey to find God is not a voyage to a far galaxy; it’s a journey inward (into repentance, prayer, contemplation) and upward (lifting our hearts in worship). Ultimately, **God must reveal Himself to us** – which Christians believe He has, supremely in Jesus Christ. All our seeking finds its answer in the person of Christ (*“Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father,”* John 14:9). We’ll discuss how Christ is the tangible “experience of God” – *“Emmanuel, God with us.”*

We’ll also talk about the role of the Holy Spirit in experiencing God. Intellectual arguments and evidence can bring us to the threshold, but it’s the Holy Spirit who makes God real in our hearts. Romans 5:5 says *“God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit.”* Many of us can share how beyond all the reasoning, it was an encounter with God’s love and grace that truly convinced us.

An important aspect here is **faith**. Faith, in the Christian sense, isn’t blind belief against evidence; it’s trust based on what we have good reason to believe is true, even if we don’t have full comprehension. We trust a God we cannot see directly, partly by *seeing* the light of His effects (much as we infer the sun is up not by looking at it – which would blind us – but by seeing everything else lit by it). We have followed rays of truth, goodness, and beauty to the Sun – now faith helps us live in that light. 2 Corinthians 5:7, *“We walk by faith, not by sight,”* will anchor a discussion on how we continue seeking God beyond this study. Our minds have been given much to chew on; now our wills must respond.

We will encourage concrete practices to “taste and see” God’s reality: prayer (even simple, honest praying can open one’s soul to God’s presence), reading Scripture devotionally (not just analytically, but listening for God’s voice), participating in sacraments and worship, and serving others (seeing Christ in “the least of these”). These are means by which abstract knowledge becomes lived knowledge.

It’s also a time for questions unresolved. Group members can share: what topics do you want to continue exploring? Perhaps someone is intrigued by something like the Trinity or the problem of evil – topics beyond this series but that naturally follow. We can outline *next steps* for continued learning (maybe another study focusing on Christian doctrine or specific apologetic questions).

Finally, we’ll revisit the beginning: the **metaphysics** we learned is not to stay in our heads. It’s to support our whole life of discipleship. Knowing God as the ground of being should increase our trust (every moment He holds us). Knowing Him as the source of truth should give us boldness to seek knowledge without fear. Knowing Him as the source of goodness should challenge us to pursue justice and love our neighbor. And knowing Him as our ultimate bliss should make us resilient and hopeful, because no matter what joys or sorrows come, our deepest fulfillment lies secure in Him.

In conclusion, our group’s *“safe space for investigating”* has hopefully shown that faith and reason work together. We don’t check our brains at the door of church; we love God with our minds. And as we do, we find that **He exceeds our minds** and meets our hearts. This ending is really a beginning – a life of continually seeking God, *who promises that those who seek will find (Matt 7:7).* Let’s commit to keep encouraging one another on this journey.

### **Key Scripture:** 

Jeremiah 29:13 (“You will seek Me and find Me when you seek Me with all your heart”); Matthew 7:7–8 (ask, seek, knock – God responds to earnest seekers); James 4:8 (“Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you”); Philippians 3:10 (“that I may know Him…”, Paul’s ongoing pursuit of Christ after decades of faith); Psalm 34:8 (“Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good!”).

### **Discussion Questions:**

* Over this series, what was one idea or insight that most strengthened or challenged your faith? How do you see God differently now than a few sessions ago?
* Intellectual knowledge vs. experiential knowledge: have you experienced moments of God’s presence or guidance that went beyond what arguments alone could provide? Would anyone like to share a brief testimony?
* What are some practical ways you intend to “seek God” moving forward? (Daily habits, prayer, study, fellowship, etc.)
* C.S. Lewis once said the prayer “*I want God*” is a real encounter with God, even if we feel nothing – because the desire for God *is* from God. Do you find hope in the fact that even our seeking is a sign of God at work within us?
* Are there remaining questions or doubts you have that you’d like to explore in the future? How can we as a group or church support one another in those?

### **Recommended Reading:**

* **Brother Lawrence – *The Practice of the Presence of God*:** A short classic by a humble cook-turned-monk on constantly enjoying God’s companionship in everyday life. Makes the immanence of God very tangible and practical.
* **Dallas Willard – *Knowing Christ Today*, Epilogue:** Willard addresses how we can genuinely know Christ in the modern world, blending intellectual clarity with spiritual intimacy.
* **J.I. Packer – *Knowing God* (especially chapters 2 and 3):** Packer distinguishes between knowing *about* God and actually knowing God, urging believers to do the latter. A great devotional theology book.
* **John Calvin – *Institutes*, Book III, ch. 2 (“On Faith”):** After all his doctrinal discussions, Calvin talks about how the Holy Spirit creates faith, uniting the believer to Christ, and how this is a work beyond mere human reason (yet not against reason). For a Reformed perspective on experiencing God through faith.

===

## **Closing Thought:** 

In the end, our metaphysical exploration is like standing on the seashore, looking at the vast ocean of God’s mystery. We’ve waded in and felt the water on our feet; we know it’s real. But there is infinitely more ahead – depths of knowing and loving God that we will spend eternity discovering. As a group, let’s encourage each other to keep wading deeper. *“Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and how inscrutable His ways!”* (Romans 11:33). And yet, this unsearchable God has searched for us, and in Jesus has made Himself known. May we continue this journey with reverence, with reason, and with rejoicing.

*“Higher than my highest, more inward than my innermost self – O God, You are my God.”* Amen.
